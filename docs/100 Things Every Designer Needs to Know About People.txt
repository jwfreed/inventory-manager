THE PSYCHOLOGY
OF DESIGN
Whether you’re designing a website, an app, software, or a medical device, the more
you know about people, the better experience you will be able to design for your
audience.
Your audience’s experience is profoundly impacted by what you know—or don’t
know—about them.
How do they think? How do they decide? What motivates them to click or purchase
or whatever it is you want them to do?
You’ll learn these things in this book.
You’ll also learn what grabs attention, what errors people make and why, and other
things that will help you design.
And you’ll design better because I’ve already done most of the heavy lifting for you.
I’m one of those strange people who like to read research. Lots and lots of research.
So I read—or in some cases, re-read—dozens of books and hundreds of research articles. I picked my favorite theories, concepts, and research studies and combined them
with the experience I’ve gained throughout the many years I’ve been designing technology interfaces.
And you’re holding the result: 100 things I think you need to know about people.
Note about the second edition: When I wrote the first edition of this book, I hoped,
of course, that it would be a popular, widely read book. But I didn’t know if people would
respond to it or not. It’s been a surprise and a heart warming experience to have the
reaction to the book be so positive. The first edition has been translated into several
languages and used as a textbook in many universities, and people often show me their
well-used book with marks and sticky notes and highlights.
It’s been several years since I wrote the first edition, and most of the material has
stood the test of time. There is some new research, however, so I decided it was time
to do a second edition. I’ve done updates, and tweaked explanations, wordings, and
images, to make sure the book stays current.
A big thank-you to all my readers for your support.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DESIGN

xi



HOW

PEOPLE
SEE

Vision trumps all the senses. Half of the brain’s resources are
dedicated to seeing and interpreting what we see. What our eyes
physically perceive is only one part of the story. The images coming in to our brains are changed and interpreted. It’s really our
brains that are “seeing.”

1

WHAT YOU SEE ISN’T WHAT YOUR
BRAIN GETS

You think that as you’re walking around looking at the world, your eyes are sending
information to your brain, which processes it and gives you a realistic experience of
“what’s out there.” But the truth is that what your brain comes up with isn’t exactly what
your eyes are seeing. Your brain is constantly interpreting everything you see. Take a
look at Figure 1.1, for example.
What do you see? At ﬁrst you probably see a triangle with a black border in the background and an upside-down white triangle on top of it. Of course, that’s not really what’s
there, is it? In reality there are merely lines and partial circles. Your brain creates the shape
of an upside-down triangle out of empty space, because that’s what it expects to see. This
particular illusion is called a Kanizsa triangle, named for the Italian psychologist Gaetano
Kanizsa, who developed it in 1955. Now look at Figure 1.2, which creates a similar illusion
with a rectangle.

FIGURE 1.1 You see triangles, but they are not really
there

FIGURE 1.2 An example of a Kanizsa rectangle

THE BRAIN CREATES SHORTCUTS
Your brain creates these shortcuts in order to quickly make sense out of the world
around you. Your brain receives millions of sensory inputs every second (the estimate is
40 million), and it’s trying to make sense of all of that input. It uses rules of thumb, based

2

HOW PEOPLE SEE

on past experience, to make guesses about what you see. Most of the time that works,
but sometimes it causes errors.
You can inﬂuence what people see, or think they see, by the use of shapes and colors. Figure 1.3 shows how color can draw attention to one message over another.

FIGURE 1.3 Color and shapes can inﬂuence what people see

8

If you need to see in the dark, don’t look straight ahead
The eye has 7 million cones that are sensitive to bright light and 125 million rods that are
sensitive to low light. The cones are in the fovea (central area of vision), and the rods are
less central. So if you’re in low light, you’ll see better if you don’t look right at the area
you’re trying to see.

Optical illusions show us the errors
Optical illusions are examples of how the brain misinterprets what the eyes see. For
example, in Figure 1.4 the line on the left looks longer than the line on the right, but
they’re actually the same length. Named for Franz Müller-Lyer, who created it in 1889,
this is one of the oldest optical illusions.

FIGURE 1.4 These lines are actually the same length

WHAT YOU SEE ISN’T WHAT YOUR BRAIN GETS

8

We see in 2D, not 3D
Light rays enter the eye through the cornea and lens. The lens focuses an image on the
retina. On the retina it is always a two-dimensional representation, even if it is a threedimensional object. This image is sent to the visual cortex in the brain, and that’s where
recognition of patterns takes place—for example, “Oh, I recognize that as a door.” The
visual cortex turns the 2D image into a 3D representation.

Takeaways

Õ What you think people are going to see when you design a product may or may not be
what they actually see. What people see might depend on their background, knowledge, familiarity with what they are looking at, and expectations.

Õ You might be able to persuade people to see things in a certain way, depending on
how you present information and visual elements. You can use shading or colors to
make it look like some things go together and others don’t.

HOW PEOPLE SEE

2

PERIPHERAL VISION IS USED MORE
THAN CENTRAL VISION TO GET THE
GIST OF WHAT YOU SEE

You have two types of vision: central and peripheral. Central vision is what you use to
look at things directly and to see details. Peripheral vision encompasses the rest of the
visual ﬁeld—areas that are visible but that you’re not looking at directly. Being able to
see things out of the corner of your eye is certainly useful, but research from Kansas
State University shows that peripheral vision is more important in understanding the
world around us than most people realize. It seems that we get information on what
type of scene we’re looking at from our peripheral vision.

8

Why movement on a screen is so annoying
People can’t help but notice movement in their peripheral vision. For example, if you’re
reading text on a screen and there’s a video that starts to play off to the side, you can’t
help but look at it. This can be quite annoying if you’re trying to concentrate on reading the text in front of you. This is peripheral vision at work! This is why advertisers use
blinking and ﬂashing in the ads that are at the periphery of web pages. Even though we
may ﬁnd it annoying, it does get our attention.

Adam Larson and Lester Loschky (2009) conducted research on central and peripheral vision in 2009, and Loschky conducted even more research in 2019. In the research
they showed people photographs of common scenes, such as a kitchen or a living room,
or outdoor scenes of cities and mountains. In some of the photographs the outside of
the image was obscured, and in others the central part of the image was obscured (Figure 2.1). Then they asked the research participants to identify what they were looking at.
Loschky found that if the central part of the photo was missing, people could still
identify what they were looking at. But when the peripheral part of the image was missing, they had a much harder time identifying what they were looking at. Loschky concluded that central vision is critical for speciﬁc object recognition, but peripheral vision is
used for getting the gist of a scene.

PERIPHERAL VISION IS USED MORE THAN CENTRAL VISION TO GET THE GIST OF WHAT YOU SEE

FIGURE 2.1 A photo used in the original Larson and Loschky research

If someone is looking at a desktop screen, you can assume that they are using both
peripheral and central vision. The same is true if they are looking at a laptop screen or a
large tablet. With mobile screens, depending on the size of the device, it is possible that
there is no peripheral vision available on the screen.

N

Peripheral vision kept our ancestors alive on the savannah
The theory, from an evolutionary standpoint, is that early humans who were sharpening
their ﬂint or looking up at the clouds and yet still noticed that a lion was coming at them
in their peripheral vision survived to pass on their genes. Those with poor peripheral
vision didn’t survive to pass on genes.
Additional research conﬁrms this idea. Dimitri Bayle (2009) placed pictures of fearful
objects in subjects’ peripheral vision or central vision. Then he measured how long it
took for the amygdala (the emotional part of the brain that responds to fearful images)
to react. When the fearful object was shown in the central vision, it took from 140 to
190 milliseconds for the amygdala to react. But when objects were shown in peripheral
vision, it took only 80 milliseconds for the amygdala to react.

6

HOW PEOPLE SEE

Takeaways

Õ If you are designing for a desktop or laptop screen, you should assume that people are
using both peripheral and central vision.

Õ Although the middle of the screen is important for central vision, don’t ignore what is in
viewers’ peripheral vision. Make sure the information in the periphery communicates
clearly the purpose of the page or information they are viewing.

Õ If you have images of an emotional nature, put them in the periphery instead of in the
middle.

Õ If you want users to concentrate on a certain part of the screen, don’t put animation or
blinking elements in their peripheral vision.

PEOPLE IDENTIFY OBJECTS BY
RECOGNIZING PATTERNS

Recognizing patterns helps you make quick sense of the sensory input that comes to
you every second. Your eyes and brain want to create patterns, even if there are no real
patterns there. In Figure 3.1, you probably see four sets of two dots each rather than
eight individual dots. You interpret the white space, or lack of it, as a pattern.

FIGURE 3.1 Your brain wants to see patterns

THE GEON THEORY OF OBJECT RECOGNITION

fi

There have been many theories over the years about how we see and recognize
objects. An early theory was that the brain has a memory bank that stores millions of
objects, and when you see an object, you compare it with all the items in your memory
bank until you nd the one that matches. But research now suggests that you recognize
basic shapes in what you are looking at, and use these basic shapes, called geometric
icons (or geons), to identify objects. Irving Biederman came up with the idea of geons
in 1987 (Figure 3.2). It’s thought that there are 24 basic shapes that we recognize; they
form the building blocks of all the objects we see and identify.
If you want people to quickly recognize what an object is, you should make use
of simple shapes. This makes it easier to recognize the basic geons that make up the
shape. The smaller the object to recognize (for example, a small icon of a printer or a
document), the more important it is to use simple geons without a lot of embellishment.

Takeaways

Õ Use patterns as much as possible, since people will automatically be looking for them.
Use grouping and white space to create patterns.

Õ If you want people to recognize an object (for example, an icon), use a simple geomet-

ric drawing of the object. This will make it easier to recognize the underlying geons
and thus make the object easier and faster to recognize.

THERE’S A SPECIAL PART OF THE
BRAIN JUST FOR RECOGNIZING FACES

fi

fi

fi

fi

Imagine that you’re walking down a busy street in a large city when you suddenly see
the face of a family member. Even if you were not expecting to see this person and
even if there are dozens or even hundreds of people in your visual eld, you will immediately recognize him or her as your relative. You’ll also have an accompanying emotional response, be it love, hate, fear, or otherwise.
Although the visual cortex is huge and takes up signi cant brain resources, there is
a special part of the brain outside the visual cortex whose sole purpose is to recognize
faces. Identi ed by Nancy Kanwisher (1997), the fusiform face area (FFA) allows faces to
bypass the brain’s usual interpretive channels and helps us identify them more quickly
than objects. The FFA is also near the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center.
This means that faces grab our attention and also evoke an emotional response. If
you show faces in your design, on a page or screen, it will grab attention immediately
and convey emotional information.
If you want to use faces to grab attention and evoke an emotional response, make
sure that the face is facing forward (not in pro le), large enough to be easily seen, and
showing the emotion you want to convey.

8

People with autism don’t view faces with the FFA
Research by Karen Pierce (2001) showed that people with autism don’t use the FFA
when looking at faces. Instead, they use other, regular pathways in the brain and visual
cortex that are normally used to recognize and interpret objects but not faces.

10

HOW PEOPLE SEE

N

We look where the face looks
Eye-tracking research shows that if a
face in a picture looks away from us
and toward a product on a web page
(Figure 4.1), we tend to also look at the
product.
But remember, just because people look
at something, it doesn’t mean they’re
paying attention. You’ll have to decide
whether you want to establish an emotional connection (the face looking right
at the viewer) or to direct attention (the
face looking directly at a product).

8

FIGURE 4.1 We look where the person looks

People are born with a preference for faces
Research by Catherine Mondloch et al. (1999) shows that newborns less than an hour
old prefer looking at something that has facial features. The FFA’s sensitivity to faces
appears to be something we are born with.

The eyes have it: people decide who and what is alive by looking
at the eyes
Christine Looser and T. Wheatley (2010) took pictures of people and then morphed them
in stages into inanimate mannequin faces. In the research, subjects are shown the stages
and asked to decide when the picture is no longer a human and alive. Figure 4.2 shows
examples of the pictures. Their research found that subjects say the pictures no longer
show someone who is alive at about the 75 percent mark. They also found that people primarily use the eyes to decide whether a picture shows someone who is human and alive.

THERE’S A SPECIAL PART OF THE BRAIN JUST FOR RECOGNIZING FACES

11

Takeaways

Õ People recognize and react to faces quickly, so if you want to grab attention, show
faces.

Õ Faces that are looking straight out at the viewer will have the greatest emotional
impact, probably because the eyes are the most important part of the face.

Õ If a face in a picture or on a web page is looking at another part of the page or at a
fi

speci c item or product, then the people viewing the image will also tend to look at
that place or product. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they will pay attention to it or
take action. It just means that they will look at it.

12

HOW PEOPLE SEE

5 THERE’S A SPECIAL PART OF THE
BRAIN FOR PROCESSING SIMPLE
VISUAL FEATURES

In 1959, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel showed that some cells in the visual cortex
respond only to horizontal lines, others respond only to vertical lines, others respond
only to edges, and still others respond only to certain angles.
The theory for many years has been that the retina receives electrical patterns from
what we look at and creates several tracks from the patterns. Some tracks contain information about shadows, others about movement, and so on. As many as 12 tracks of
information are then sent to the brain’s visual cortex. In the visual cortex special areas
respond to and process the information. For example, one area responds only to lines

only to edges.
Eventually all of the data are combined into just two tracks: one for movement (is this
object moving?) and another for location (where is this object in relation to me?).

Hubel and Wiesel’s research held for 60 years. But more recent research, by Garg
(2019), shows that there might be neurons that process two features at a time: color and
orientation. Still, the idea is that the visual information is processed in small bits, one or
maybe two features at a time.
This means that if you want to grab visual attention, the best way to do it is to have
one element look different from any others. Have one item be a different color. Or
have one item be a different shape.
Compare the image in Figure 5.1 to the one in Figure 5.2. In the rst image only one
circle is a different color, so you notice it right away. In Figure 5.2 all the circles are different colors, which means that no particular circle stands out.

The visual cortex is more active when you are imagining
The visual cortex is more active when you are imagining something than when you are
actually perceiving it (Solso, 2005). Activity occurs in the same location in the visual cortex, but there is more activity when we imagine. The theory is that the visual cortex has
to work harder because the stimulus is not actually present.

A mistake that designers sometimes make is to use several of these visual features
together. If on one page or in one image you have several different colors, shapes, and
angles, it may take the visual cortex longer to process that information. You won’t be as
effective in grabbing visual attention.

Takeaways

Õ If you want to grab visual attention quickly, then remember that less is more.
Õ In an image or on a page, whatever item is a different color, shape, or orientation than
fi

the others is the item that will grab attention rst.

Õ You will grab more attention if you use just one feature at a time. But if you are going to
use two, then the two to use together are color and orientation (tilt or angle).

6 PEOPLE SCAN SCREENS BASED ON

PAST EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS

Where do people look ﬁrst on a screen or page? Where do they look next? It depends
partially on what they’re doing and expecting. If they read in a language that moves
from left to right, they tend to look at the screen from left to right. If they read from right
to left, the opposite is true.
Most people, though, don’t start in the topmost corner. Because people have gotten
used to the idea that there are things on screens and pages that are less relevant to the
task at hand, such as logos and blank space, they tend to use their central vision to look
for meaningful information about 30 percent in from the edge and 30 percent in from the
top. In Figure 6.1 the menu bar and the link to get started with Medicare are pulled in
and down about 30 percent from the top and the sides, which is where most people will
start looking for important information.

Figure 6.1 The menu bar and the link to get started with Medicare are placed where most people will look for
meaningful information on a page

After a ﬁrst glance at a screen, people move in their culture’s normal reading pattern
(left to right, or right to left, and top to bottom). If something grabs their attention somewhere else on the screen—for example, a large photo (especially one with someone’s
face) or movement (an animated banner or video)—then you can pull them away from this
normal tendency.

PEOPLE SCAN SCREENS BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS

15

PEOPLE HAVE A MENTAL MODEL OF WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE
AND WHERE THEY WANT TO SEE IT
People have a mental model of where things tend to be on screens or pages, and a
mental model for particular applications or websites that they use. They tend to look at
a screen based on these mental models. For example, if they shop at Amazon a lot and
use the search ﬁeld, they’ll likely look right at where they expect the search ﬁeld to be.

IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, PEOPLE NARROW THEIR VIEW
If there is an error or unexpected problem with the task people are trying to accomplish,
then they stop looking at other parts of the screen and focus on the problem area. We’ll
discuss this more in the “People Make Mistakes” chapter.

Takeaways

Õ Put the most important information (or things you want people to focus on) about 30

percent of the page or screen from the top and 30 percent from the left margin (or from
the right margin if they are reading in a language that moves from right to left).

Õ Avoid putting task-related information at the edges, since people tend not to look
there with central vision.

Õ Save the edges for peripheral vision, which may include images with emotion or anything that will give the “gist” of the scene—for example, logos, branding, and navigation menus.

Õ Design the screen or page so that people can move in their normal reading pattern.
Avoid a pattern that forces people to bounce back and forth to many parts of the
screen to accomplish a task.

PEOPLE SEE CUES THAT TELL THEM
WHAT TO DO WITH AN OBJECT

You’ve probably had the experience of encountering a door handle that doesn’t work
the way it should: the handle looks like you should pull, but in fact you need to push.
In the real world, objects communicate to you about how you can, and should, interact
with them. For example, by their size and shape, doorknobs invite you to grab and turn
them. The handle on a coffee mug tells you to curl a few ﬁngers through it and lift it up.
A pair of scissors invites you to put ﬁngers through the circles and move your thumb up
and down to open and close. If the item, like the door handle, gives you cues that don’t
work, you get annoyed and frustrated. These cues are called affordances.
James Gibson wrote about the idea of affordance in 1979. He described affordances
as action possibilities in the environment. In 1988 Don Norman modiﬁed the idea of affordances in his book The Design of Everyday Things. He referred to the idea of perceived
affordances: if you want people to take action on an object, whether in real life or on a
computer screen, you need to make sure that they can easily perceive, ﬁgure out, and
interpret what the object is and what they can and should do with it.
When you try to accomplish a task, such as opening a door to a room or ordering a
book on a website, you automatically, and largely unconsciously, look around you to ﬁnd
objects and tools to help you. If you are the one designing the environment for the task,
make sure that the objects in the environment are easy to see, are easy to ﬁnd, and have
clear affordances.
Take a look at the door handle in Figure 7.1. Because of its shape, you’ll tend to grab
it and pull down. If that’s the way it works, then you’d say that the door handle is well
designed and that it has a clear perceived affordance.

FIGURE 7.1 This door handle invites you to grab and pull down

PEOPLE SEE CUES THAT TELL THEM WHAT TO DO WITH AN OBJECT

17

You’ve probably encountered a door handle that is shaped in a way that invites you
to grab and pull, but then also has a PUSH sign. When the cue doesn’t match the function, then you end up having to post confusing messages so that people know how
to interact with the object. When an object is giving cues that go against how it really
works, that is known as providing an incorrect affordance.

PERCEIVED AFFORDANCES ON SCREENS
When you’re designing an application or website, think about the affordances of objects
on the screen. For example, have you ever wondered what makes people want to click
a button? Cues in the button’s shadow tell people that it can be pushed in, the way a
button on an actual device can be pushed in.
Figure 7.2 shows a button on a remote control. The shape and shadows give you
cues that encourage you to press the button to activate it.

FIGURE 7.2 Buttons on physical devices have shadows that make you want to press them

You can simulate these shadows online too. In Figure 7.3, shadows of different colors
around the edges make the button look pushed in. Try turning the book upside down
and looking at the same button. Now it will look like it’s not pushed in, and the shadows
will give cues to push the button.

18

FIGURE 7.3 This button looks pushed in, but turn the book upside down and see

fi

These visual cues are subtle, but they are important. Many buttons have some of
these visual cues, such as the button in Figure 7.4, but lately buttons are losing the cues.
In Figure 7.5, the button is just text in a colored square.
And if someone is using a touch screen or tablet instead of a mouse or trackpad,
then a button might not have any visual cues, such as an arrow or a hand with a nger
pointing up.

HYPERLINKS ARE LOSING THEIR AFFORDANCE CUES TOO

fi

fi

Most people have ﬁgured out the affordance cue that blue, underlined text means that
the text is hyperlinked, and if you click, it you will go to the linked site or page. But lately
many hyperlinks are more subtle, with the only cue that they are clickable showing up
when you hover.
Figure 7.6 shows a page that has no initial affordance cues about what can be
clicked. (You need to hover over something to nd out what’s clickable.) To see links,
you have to wander over the page with your nger on your mouse.

Takeaways

Õ Think about affordance cues when you design. By giving people cues about what they
can do with a particular object, you make it more likely that they will take that action.

Õ Use shading to show when an object is chosen or active.
Õ Avoid providing incorrect affordance cues.

If you haven’t seen what is famously called the “gorilla video,” then you should check out
the rst video on my blog: www.blog.theteamw.com/2009/10/25/100-things-you-shouldknow-about-people-1-inattention-blindness/. Take the Selective Attention Test. If you
don’t do this now, then I will spoil the effect for you below as I discuss the video.

fi

fi

The “gorilla video” is an example of inattention blindness or change blindness. The idea
is that people often miss large changes in their visual elds. This has been shown in
many experiments, although the basketball/gorilla experiment is the best known.
In their book The Invisible Gorilla, Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons (2010)
describe additional research they did with eye-tracking equipment. Eye tracking is a
technology that can track where someone is looking. More speci cally, it tracks where
the foveal, or central, gaze is. It doesn’t track peripheral vision. Eye-tracking research
shows that everyone watching the basketball/gorilla video “sees” the gorilla in the video,
meaning that their central vision is looking at the gorilla, but only 50 percent are aware
that they have seen the gorilla. Chabris and Simons have conducted many studies on
this phenomenon, and they have concluded that if you are paying attention to one thing
and you don’t expect changes to appear, then you can easily miss changes that do
occur.

Eye-tracking data can be misleading

fi

Eye tracking is a technology that allows you to see and record what a person is looking
at, in what order, and for how long. It is often used to study where people are looking,
either on a screen, on a page, or even in a physical environment. It can track where people look rst, second, and so on. One of its bene ts is that you don’t have to rely on what
people say they are looking at, but instead you can collect the data directly. But eyetracking data can be misleading for several reasons: 1) As we’ve discussed in this section, eye tracking tells you what people looked at, but that doesn’t mean that they paid
attention to it. 2) The research on peripheral vision in this chapter tells us that peripheral
fi

8

  

N

PEOPLE CAN MISS CHANGES IN THEIR VISUAL FIELDS

21

vision is just as important as central vision. Eye tracking measures only central vision.
3) Early eye-tracking research by Alfred Yarbus (1967) showed that what people look at
depends on what questions they are asked while they are looking. It’s therefore easy to
accidentally skew the eye-tracking data depending on what instructions you give participants before and during the study.

Takeaways

Õ Don’t assume that people will see something on a screen or page just because it’s
fi

there. This is especially true when you refresh a screen and make one change on
it—for example, the screen reappears with a message about an incorrect piece of
data entered in a form eld. Users may not even realize they are looking at a different
screen.
fi

Õ If you want to be sure that people notice a change in their visual eld, add additional
visual cues (such as blinking) or auditory cues (such as a beep).

Õ Be cautious about how you interpret eye-tracking data. Don’t ascribe too much importance to it or use it as the main basis for design decisions.

9 PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THINGS THAT
ARE CLOSE TOGETHER BELONG
TOGETHER

If two items are near each other (a photo and text, for example), then people assume
they go together. This connection is strongest for items that are together left to right.
In Figure 9.1, the distance between columns is the same as the distance between
rows. This makes it difficult to know which headings and photos belong together. Because
the left-to-right connection is stronger than the top-to-bottom connection—and in the
absence of any other visual cues—most people will assume that a heading on the left
goes with the picture to its right. This is not the case, which makes the page hard to use.

FIGURE 9.1 It’s hard to tell which heading goes with which photo

Takeaways

Õ If you want items (pictures, photos, headings, or text) to be seen as belonging together,
then put them in proximity.

fi

Õ Before you use lines or boxes to separate items or group them together, rst try experimenting with the amount of space between them. Sometimes changing the spacing is
sufficient, and you’ll be reducing the visual noise of the page.

Õ Put more space between items that don’t go together and less space between items that
do. This sounds like common sense, but many page and screen layouts ignore this idea.

When lines or text of different colors are projected or printed, the depths of the lines
may appear to be different. One color may jump out while another color appears
recessed. This effect is called chromostereopsis. The effect is strongest with red and
blue, but it can also happen with other colors (for example, red and green). These color
combinations can be hard and tiring to look at or read. Figure 10.1 shows some examples of chromostereopsis.

The term color blindness is actually a misnomer. Most people who are “color-blind”
are not blind to all colors, but really have a color deﬁciency that makes it hard for them
to see differences between some colors. Most color blindness is hereditary, although
some can be acquired through disease or injury. Most of the color genes are on the X
chromosome. Since men have only one X chromosome and women have two, men are
more likely to have problems with color vision than women.
There are many different kinds of color blindness, but the most common is a difficulty
distinguishing between reds, yellows, and greens. This is called “red-green” color blindness. Other forms, such as problems distinguishing blues from yellows, or where everything looks gray, are very rare.
Figure 11.1 shows a map of winter driving conditions from the Wisconsin Department
of Transportation’s website as it appears to someone who has no color blindness. Figure 11.2 shows the same page as a person with red-green color blindness would see
it, and Figure 11.3 shows the same page as a person with blue-yellow color deﬁciency
would see it. Notice that the colors are different.
The rule of thumb is that wherever you use color to give speciﬁc meaning, you need
a redundant coding scheme—for example, color and line thickness—so that people who
are color-blind will be able to decipher the code without needing to see speciﬁc colors.

the spread of inﬂuenza for a particular week. At this site they have purposely picked

There are several sites you can use to check how your images or website will appear to
someone who has color blindness. Here are two I recommend:
www.vischeck.com
colorﬁlter.wickline.org

N

Those who are color-blind can often see camouflage better
Some say it is because they are not distracted by color, while others say it is because
those who are color-blind are used to looking for pattern, texture, or other cues. Regardless of the reason, some color-blind individuals can see camouﬂage better than those
who have full-color vision.

Takeaways

fi

Õ Check your images and websites with www.vischeck.com or color lter.wickline.org to
see how they will look to someone who is color-blind.

Õ If you use color to imply a certain meaning (for example, items in green need immediate attention), use a redundant coding scheme (items in green and with a box around
them need immediate attention).

Õ When designing color coding, consider colors that work for everyone—for example,
varying shades of brown and yellow.

COLORS MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS TO

I once worked with a client who had created a color map of the different business
regions for their company, showing the total revenue for the quarter for each region.
Yellow was for the eastern part of the U.S., green for the central states, and red for the
western states. The VP of Sales got to the podium and started showing his slide deck
to the nancial and accounting staff of the company. Up came the colored map and a
gasp could be heard in the auditorium, followed by the buzz of urgent conversation. The
VP tried to continue his talk, but he had lost everyone’s attention. They were all talking
amongst themselves.
Finally someone blurted out, “What the heck is going on in the West?”
“What do you mean?” the VP asked. “Nothing is going on. They had a great quarter.”
To an accountant or nancial person, red is a bad thing. It means they are losing
money. The presenter had to explain that he had just randomly picked red.
Colors have associations and meanings. For example, red means “in the red,” or
nancial trouble, or it could mean danger or stop. Green means money or “go.” Pick colors carefully because they have these meanings. And different colors might mean different things to subgroups.
If you are designing for people in different parts of the world, then you also have
to consider the color meanings in other cultures. A few colors have similar meanings
everywhere (gold, for example, stands for success and high quality in most cultures), but
most colors have different meanings in other cultures. For example, in the U.S. white is
used at weddings, but in other cultures white is the color used for death and funerals.
Happiness is associated with white, green, yellow, or red, depending on the part of the
world you are in.

Research on color and moods
Research shows that colors affect mood. The restaurant and hospitality industry has
studied this a lot. For example, in the U.S. orange makes people agitated, so they won’t
stay long (useful in fast food restaurants). Browns and blues are soothing, so people
will stay (useful in bars). However, in order for a color to affect mood, the person has to
be sitting in a room surrounded by that color. The effect does not seem to work if he or
she is simply looking at a screen that has a particular color on it.

Takeaways

Õ Choose your colors carefully, taking into account the meaning that the colors may
invoke.

Õ Pick a few major cultures or countries that you will be reaching with your design and

check them on the cultural color chart from InformationIsBeautiful.net to be sure you’re
avoiding unintended color associations for that culture.

With adult literacy rates now over 80 percent worldwide, reading

we read? And what should designers know about reading?

13

IT’S A MYTH THAT WORDS IN ALL
CAPS ARE INHERENTLY HARD
TO READ

You’ve probably heard that words in uppercase letters are harder to read than those in
mixed case or lowercase. You’ve probably even heard some kind of percentage cited,
such as “between 14 and 20 percent harder.” The story goes that we read by recognizing the shapes of words and groups of words. Words in mixed case or lowercase letters
have unique shapes. Words in all caps have the same shape—a rectangle of a certain
size—so, in theory, they’re harder to distinguish (Figure 13.1).

FIGURE 13.1 The word shape theory

This explanation sounds plausible, but it’s not really accurate. There’s no research
showing that the shapes of words help us read more accurately or more quickly. A psycholinguist named James Cattell came up with that idea in 1886. There was some evidence for it then, but more recent work by Kenneth Paap (1984) and Keith Rayner (1998)
has revealed that what we’re actually doing when we read is recognizing and anticipating
letters. And then, based on the letters, we recognize the word. Let’s look more closely at
how we read.

READING ISN’T AS FLUID AS IT SEEMS
When we read, we have the impression that our eyes are moving smoothly across the
page, but that’s not what’s actually happening. Our eyes move in quick, sharp jumps,
with short periods of stillness in between. The jumps are called saccades (about seven
to nine letters at a time), and the moments of stillness are called ﬁxations (about 250

32

HOW PEOPLE READ

milliseconds long). During the saccades, we can’t see anything—we’re essentially blind—
but the movements are so fast that we don’t even realize they’re happening. Our eyes
look forward during most of the saccades, but they look backward 10 to 15 percent of the
time, rereading letters and words.
Figure 13.2 shows an example of the saccade and ﬁxation pattern. The black dots
are the ﬁxations, and the curved lines are the saccade movements.
Fortunately these saccades are really fast so you are not blind for long.

They are so fast that you don’t even realize they are happening.
FIGURE 13.2 An example of a saccade and fixation pattern

N

We use peripheral vision when we read
A saccade spans about seven to nine letters, but our perceptual span is actually double
that. In 1996, Kenneth Goodman found that we use peripheral vision to see what comes
next when we read. We read ahead about 15 letters at a time, viewing the characters to
the right (assuming we’re reading left to right), although now and then a saccade jumps
us backward and we reread a group of letters. Although we read ahead about 15 letters
at a time, we only get the meaning for part of that span. We pick up the semantic cues of
letters 1 through 7, but merely recognize letters 8 through 15.

8

Reading music is similar to reading text
People who read music ﬂuently use the same saccades, ﬁxations, and reading ahead of
15 “letters” that they do when reading text.

SO IS IT HARDER TO READ TEXT THAT IS IN ALL CAPS?
We do actually read uppercase letters more slowly, but only because we don’t see them
as often. Most of what we read is in mixed case, so we’re used to seeing mixed case. If
you practice reading text in all caps, you’ll eventually read that text as fast as you read
mixed case. This doesn’t mean you should start using all caps for all your text. Since
people are unused to reading that way, it will initially slow them down. And these days,
text in all caps is perceived as “shouting” (Figure 13.3).

Õ People perceive all caps as shouting, and they’re unused to reading text in all caps, so
use all caps sparingly.

Õ Save all caps text for headlines and when you need to get someone’s attention (for
fi

example, before deleting an important le).

If you’re a biologist, then this paragraph might make sense right away:
The regulation of the TCA cycle is largely determined by substrate availability and product inhibition. NADH, a product of all of the dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle, with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase,
inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and
a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, while succinyl-CoA inhibits succinylCoA synthetase and citrate synthase.
If you’re not a biologist, then it might take you a long time to understand what that
paragraph says. You can read the paragraph, but that doesn’t mean you understand it.
New information is assimilated more thoroughly when it is plugged into existing cognitive
structures.

READABILITY FORMULAS
There are formulas you can use to calculate the readability of a particular passage of
text. An example is the Flesch-Kincaid formula. It provides both a reading ease score
and a reading grade-level score. The higher the score, the easier the passage is to
read. Low scores mean the passage is hard to read. The formula is shown in Figure 14.1.
206.835 – 1.015

(

total words
total sentences

)

– 84.6

(

total syllables
total words

)

FIGURE 14.1 The Flesch-Kincaid readability formula

fi

fi

There are several other formulas as well, but none of them is perfect, so use them with
caution. Most readability formulas are based on the average length of words and sentences. The assumption is that if a passage of text has long words and long sentences,
then it will be harder to read. The formulas don’t take into account whether the speci c
terminology or vocabulary will be hard for a speci c audience to read or understand.
Many of the formulas give you a “grade-level” score—for example, that the passage
of text is at an eighth-grade reading level or a tenth-grade reading level. If you use different formulas on the same text passage, you are likely to get some variation in the gradelevel score.
This means that readability formulas are not exact and not perfect, yet they can give
you an idea of how easy or hard a particular text passage will be to read.

There are several tools for calculating readability.
I tested a text passage from one of my blog articles by copying and pasting the text into
a readability formula website: https://readabilityformulas.com/freetests/six-readability
-formulas.php.
Here is the text I tested:
“But doing nothing so you can then be better at doing something seems to run counter
to the idea of niksen. What about doing nothing so that you just do nothing?
“I’ve been teaching an 8-week Mindfulness Meditation course once or twice a year at
my local yoga studio (a wonderful place called 5 Koshas in Wausau, Wisconsin). The
8-week class includes homework, such as practicing the meditation we learned in class
that week every day at home, and so on. It’s a pretty intensive class.

fi

fi

“The last time I taught it I added to the homework. I asked students to practice 5 minutes
a day of niksen. I asked them to sit in nature or stare out their window, or sit in a comfy
chair at home and look at the re in the replace, or just stare into space. This was the
one thing I got pushback on. They were willing to practice meditation for 20 minutes
every day, but to sit and do nothing for 5 minutes? ‘I don’t have the time to do that’ was
the typical answer. ‘I have responsibilities, children, work…’”
The website used several different formulas to calculate readability. Here are the scores
it gave me:

Flesch reading ease score: 76.3, fairly easy to read
Flesch-Kincaid grade level: seventh grade
Gunning Fog: 8.4, fairly easy to read
Coleman-Liau index: sixth grade
SMOG index: sixth grade

People use different parts of the brain to process words
Words are processed in different parts of the brain depending on what you’re doing with
them. Viewing or reading words, listening, speaking, generating verbs—all of these word
activities engage different parts of the brain, as shown in Figure 14.2.

WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF WHAT YOU READ DEPENDS ON YOUR
POINT OF VIEW
In a study by Anderson and Pichert (1978), people read a story about a house and
the contents within the house. One group was told to read the story from a buyer’s
standpoint, and another group was told to read the story from a burglar’s point of view.
The information they remembered after reading the story differed depending on their
viewpoint.

HOW PEOPLE READ

Takeaways

Õ People are active readers. What they understand and remember from what they read
depends on their previous experience, their point of view while reading, and the
instructions they are given beforehand.
fi

Õ Don’t assume that people will remember speci c information in what they read.
Õ Provide a meaningful title or headline. It’s one of the most important things you can do.
Õ Tailor the reading level of your text to your audience. Use simple words and fewer syllables to make your material accessible to a wider audience.

15 PATTERN RECOGNITION HELPS
PEOPLE IDENTIFY LETTERS IN
DIFFERENT FONTS

People have been debating which fonts are better, easier to read, or most appropriate
for centuries. One such debate centers around the use of two types of font: serif versus
sans serif. Some argue that sans serif typefaces are easier to read because they are
plain; others contend that serif fonts are easier to read because the serifs draw the eye
toward the next letter. In fact, research shows no difference in comprehension, reading
speed, or preference between serif and sans serif fonts.

N

People identify letters through pattern recognition
How is it that you can recognize all of the marks in Figure 15.1 as the letter A?

FIGURE 15.1 We can recognize many variations of a letter
You haven’t memorized all of these versions of the letter A. Instead you’ve formed a
memory pattern of what an A looks like. When you see something similar, your brain recognizes the pattern. (See the discussion of geons in the chapter called “How We See”
for more information about how we recognize shapes.)

Designers use fonts to evoke a mood, brand, or association. Some font families
invoke a time period (old fashioned versus modern), while others convey seriousness or
playfulness. In terms of readability, however, the font you choose is not critical as long as
it is not so decorative as to make it hard to identify the letters; some fonts interfere with
the brain’s ability to recognize patterns.

IF A FONT IS HARD TO READ, PEOPLE THINK THE TASK
IS HARD TO DO
Hyunjin Song and Norbert Schwarz (2008) gave people written instructions on how to
do a physical exercise. If the instructions were in an easy-to-read font (such as Arial),
people estimated that it would take about eight minutes to do the exercise and that it
wouldn’t be too difficult. They were willing to incorporate the exercise into their daily
workout. But if the instructions were given in an overly decorative font (such as Brush
Script MT Italic), people estimated it would take almost twice as long—15 minutes—to
do the exercise, and they rated the exercise as being difficult to do (Figure 15.3). They
were also less likely to be willing to incorporate it into their routine.

FIGURE 15.3 If the text used for instructions is hard to read, as it is in the second text sample, the reader likewise
will think the instructions are hard to do

Takeaways

Õ Serif and sans serif fonts are equal in terms of readability.
Õ Unusual or overly decorative fonts can interfere with pattern recognition and slow
down reading.

Õ If people have trouble reading the font, they will transfer that feeling of difficulty to

the meaning of the text itself and decide that the subject of the text is hard to do or
understand.

16 FONT SIZE MATTERS
When it comes to fonts, size matters a lot. The font size needs to be big enough for
users to read the text without strain. And it’s not just older individuals who need fonts to
be bigger—young people also complain when font sizes are too small to read.
Some fonts can be the same size but look bigger due to the x-height. The x-height
is literally the height of the lowercase x in the font family. Different fonts have different
x-heights, and as a result, some fonts look larger than others, even though they are the
same point size.
Figure 16.1 shows how font size and x-height are measured.

FIGURE 16.1 How font size and x-height are measured

Some newer font families, such as Tahoma and Verdana, have been designed with
large x-heights so they are easier to read on a screen. Figure 16.2 shows different font
families that are all the same point size. Some look bigger, however, because of their
larger x-height.

FIGURE 16.2 Large x-heights can make a font look larger

READING A SCREEN IS HARDER THAN
READING PAPER

Reading text on a screen is different from reading text on paper. When you read on a
screen, the image is not stable—it is being refreshed, and the screen is emitting light.
When you read text on paper, the image is stable (not being refreshed), and instead of
emitting light, the paper is reflecting light. The refreshing of the image and emitting of
the light on the screen are tiring on the eyes. Electronic ink (as in the Kindle) mimics the
appearance of ink on paper. It reflects light and holds the text stable without refreshing.
To make text on a screen easier to read, make sure you use a large enough font and
create enough contrast between foreground and background. Figure 17.1 shows the
best combination to use for readability: black text on a white background

FIGURE 17.1 Black text on a white background is easiest to read

Takeaways

Õ Use a large point size for text that will be read on a screen. This will help minimize
eyestrain.

Õ Break text up into chunks. Use bullets, short paragraphs, and pictures.
Õ Provide ample contrast between foreground and background. Black text on a white
background is the most readable.

Õ Make sure your content is worth reading. In the end, it all boils down to whether or not the

17

  

text on the page is of interest to your audience. Make sure you know what your audience
wants or needs to read and then provide them with that content as clearly as possible.

READING A SCREEN IS HARDER THAN READING PAPER

18 PEOPLE READ FASTER WITH A

LONGER LINE LENGTH, BUT THEY
PREFER A SHORTER LINE LENGTH

Have you ever had to decide what column width to use on a screen? Should it be a
wide column, with 100 characters per line? Or a short column, with 50 characters per
line? Or something in between? The answer depends on whether you want people to
read faster or to like the page.
Mary Dyson (2004) conducted research on line length and combed other studies to
determine what line length people prefer. Her work showed that 100 characters per line
is the optimal length for onscreen reading speed, but we prefer a short or medium line
length (45 to 72 characters per line).

N

Longer line lengths are easier to read because they interfere less
with the flow of saccades and fixations
Every time you get to the end of a line, you interrupt saccade and ﬁxation eye movement. A shorter line length creates more of these interruptions over the total length of
the piece you are reading.

The research also found that we can read a single wide column faster than multiple
columns, but we prefer multiple columns.
If you ask people which they prefer, they will say multiple columns with short line
lengths. Interestingly, if you ask them which they read faster, they will insist it is also the
multiple columns with short line lengths, even though the data shows otherwise.
Figure 18.1 is an example of a long line length. Figure 18.2 is an example of a short
line length.
Line length presents a quandary: Do you give people the short lines and multiple
columns that they prefer or go against their own preference and intuition, knowing that
they will read faster if you use longer lines and a single column? You have to decide what
is more important for the particular content you are providing and the particular audience
who is reading. For each instance, which is more important, speed or preference?

For example, if you are presenting updated information to medical professionals on
a web page about the latest outbreak of a virus, you may want to consider a longer line
length to promote reading speed. The audience is already motivated to read the content
(they want the latest update as fast as possible), so speed is important. Use a longer line
length, for example 80 to 100 characters per line.

PEOPLE READ FASTER WITH A LONGER LINE LENGTH, BUT THEY PREFER A SHORTER LINE LENGTH

47

On the other hand, if you are writing content on the newest modern art exhibit at your
local art museum and you are hoping that the art lovers in your community will read the
article and then want to come see the exhibit, you should probably choose a shorter line
length to entice them to read the article. If the line length is too long, they may not stick
around to read it. Use 45 to 72 characters per line.

Takeaways

Õ You have to decide what is more important for the particular content you are providing
and the particular audience who is reading. For each instance, which is more important, speed or preference?

Õ Use a longer line length (80 to 100 characters per line) if your reader needs to read
quickly.

Õ Use a shorter line length (45 to 72 characters per line) if your reader doesn’t necessarily need to read quickly.

We’ll come back to this list later. First, let’s learn about the frailties
and complexities of human memory.

-

19 SHORT TERM MEMORY IS LIMITED
We’ve all experienced this moment: you’re on the phone and the person you’re talking
to gives you the name and number of someone you need to call right away. You don’t
have a pen or paper to write down the information, so you repeat the name and number
over and over to help yourself remember them. You try to get off the phone quickly so
you can make the call while the number is still running through your head. You may ﬁnd
that your memory isn’t very reliable in this situation.
Psychologists have many theories about how this type of memory works; some refer
to it as short-term memory, others as working memory. In this chapter we’ll call this type
of quick memory—the memory you need for less than a minute—working memory.

WORKING MEMORY AND FOCUSED ATTENTION

­

­

There’s only so much people can hold in working memory before they forget it. Infor
mation in working memory is easily interfered with. For example, if you’re trying to
remember a name and phone number and someone starts talking to you at the same
time, you’re probably going to get very annoyed. You’re also going to forget the
name and number. If you don’t concentrate, you’ll lose it from working memory. This
is because working memory is tied to your ability to focus attention. To maintain infor
mation in working memory, you must keep your attention focused on it.

N

The brain lights up when working memory is active

fi

Theories about memory date to the 1800s. Now researchers can use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to actually see which parts of the brain are
active when people perform various tasks and engage with different images, words,
and sounds. When a task involves working memory, the prefrontal cortex (which focuses
attention) lights up. Other parts of the brain are also active during tasks that employ
working memory. For example, if the task includes remembering words or numbers, then
there will also be activity in the left hemisphere. If the task involves spatial relations,
such as nding something on a map, then the right hemisphere will also be active.

fi

fi

Perhaps the most interesting nding is that the connection between these areas of the
brain and the prefrontal cortex increases when working memory is in use. While working
memory is active, the prefrontal cortex is choosing strategies and deciding what to pay
attention to; this has a signi cant impact on memory.

50

HOW PEOPLE REMEMBER

8

Stress impairs working memory
Scans of the brain using fMRI show that there is less activity in the prefrontal cortex (the
part of your brain right behind your forehead) when you’re under stress. This indicates
that stress reduces the effectiveness of working memory.

WORKING MEMORY VS. SENSORY INPUT
Interestingly, there is an inverse relationship between working memory and the amount
of sensory input you’re processing at any given time. People with high-functioning
working memories are better able to screen out what’s going on around them. Your
prefrontal cortex determines what you should pay attention to. If you can tune out all the
sensory stimuli around you and instead focus your attention on the one thing in your
working memory, you’ll be able to remember it.

N

More working memory equals better performance in school
Recent research links working memory and academic success. Tracy Alloway (2010)
tested the working memory capacity of a group of ﬁve-year-olds and then tracked the
children over time. Working memory at age ﬁve predicted how well the children did
through high school and beyond: those with higher working memory capacities were
more successful academically. This shouldn’t be a surprise, since working memory is
involved in remembering instructions from a teacher and, as we will discuss later, is part
of long-term memory. What is interesting, though, is that working memory can be tested;
then, if the child’s score is low, the results can be used to plan an intervention. It’s a relatively fast and easy way to ﬁnd out which students are at risk for school problems, and it
gives educators and parents the opportunity to tackle those problems early on.

Takeaways

Õ Don’t ask people to remember information from one place to another, such as reading
letters or numbers on one page and then entering them on another page; if you do,
they’ll probably forget the information and get frustrated.

Õ If you ask people to remember things in working memory, don’t ask them to do any-

19

  

thing else until they’ve completed that task. Working memory is sensitive to interference—too much sensory input will prevent them from focusing attention.

SHORT-TERM MEMORY IS LIMITED

51

20 PEOPLE REMEMBER ONLY FOUR
ITEMS AT ONCE

If you’re familiar with usability, psychology, or memory research, you’ve probably heard
the phrase ”the magical number seven, plus or minus two.” This refers, actually, to what
I would call an urban legend: George A. Miller (1956) wrote a research paper showing
that people can remember from ﬁve to nine (seven plus or minus two) things and that
people can process seven plus or minus two pieces of information at a time. So you
should only put ﬁve to nine items on a menu, or have ﬁve to nine tabs on a screen. Have
you heard that story? Well, it’s not quite accurate.

WHY IT’S AN URBAN LEGEND
Psychologist Alan Baddeley questioned the seven plus or minus two rule. Baddeley
(1994) dug up Miller’s paper and discovered that it wasn’t a paper describing actual
research; it was a talk that Miller gave at a professional meeting. And it was basically
Miller thinking out loud about whether there is some kind of inherent limit to the amount
of information that people can process at a time.
Baddeley (1986) conducted a long series of studies on human memory and information processing. Others, including Nelson Cowan (2001), followed in his footsteps. The
research now shows that the “magical” number is four.

USING CHUNKS TO TURN FOUR INTO MORE
People can hold three or four things in working memory as long as they aren’t distracted and their processing of the information is not interfered with.
One of the interesting strategies people employ to help our fragile memories is
“chunking” information together into groups. It’s no accident that U.S. phone numbers
look like this:
712-569-4532
Instead of having to remember 10 separate numerals, a phone number has three
chunks, with four or fewer items in each chunk. If you know the area code by heart (that
is, it’s stored in long-term memory), then you don’t have to remember that part of the
number, so you can ignore one whole chunk.
Years ago phone numbers were easier to remember because you mainly called
people in your area code, so you didn’t have to hold the area code in working memory.

52

HOW PEOPLE REMEMBER

It was in long-term memory, which we will get to shortly. In the good old days you didn’t
even need to use the area code if the number you were calling from was in the same
area code as you were dialing from (not true anymore in most places). And to make it
even easier, everyone in town had the same exchange (the 569 part of the previous
phone number). If you were dialing someone in your town with the same exchange, all
you had to remember was the last four numbers. No problem! (I know I’m dating myself
here by telling you how it used to be back in the old days. I live now in a small town in
Wisconsin, and people here still give their number to others as the last four digits only,
even though just four numbers won’t work anymore.)

THE FOUR-ITEM RULE APPLIES TO MEMORY RETRIEVAL TOO
The four-item rule applies not only to working memory but also to long-term memory.
George Mandler (1969) showed that people could memorize information in categories
and then retrieve it from memory perfectly if there were one to three items in a category. The number of items recalled dropped steadily when each category contained
more than three items. If there were four to six items in a category, then people could
remember 80 percent of the items. It went down from there, falling to 20 percent if there
were 80 items in the category (Figure 20.1).

Donald Broadbent (1975) asked people to recall items in different categories—for
example, the Seven Dwarfs, the seven colors of the rainbow, the countries of Europe, or
the names of current shows on TV. People remembered two, three, or four items clustered together.

PEOPLE REMEMBER ONLY FOUR ITEMS AT ONCE

53

8

Even chimps can do it

fi

Nobuyuki Kawai and Tetsuro Matsuzawa (2000) trained a chimpanzee to take memory
tests similar to the ones that are given to humans. The chimpanzee (named Ai) could correctly complete the memory tasks with 95 percent accuracy when she had to memorize
four numbers. She was only 65 percent correct when there were ve numbers.

Takeaways

Õ Limit the number of choices or items to three or four. For example, when you provide links that people can go to for more information, limit the number of links to
three or four.

Õ If you can’t limit the number of links, topics, or choices to three or four, chunk or group

information into three or four groups. For example, when you are asking people to
choose what to do next, instead of showing them a list of 10 topics or items to click
on, group like items together and show three or four groups with three or four items in
each group.

Õ When you chunk or group information, make sure there are no more than four items in
each chunk.

Õ Be aware that people tend to use external aids, sometimes called “job aids,” when

their working memory is being overloaded. If you observe people using your product
and they have to refer to lists, notes, sticky notes, and so on while they are using the
product, that is an indication that you are overloading working memory.

54

HOW PEOPLE REMEMBER

21 PEOPLE HAVE TO USE INFORMATION
TO MAKE IT STICK

How do people move things from working memory into long-term memory? There are
basically two ways: repeat it a lot, or connect it to something they already know.

REPETITION PHYSICALLY CHANGES THE BRAIN

fi

fi

There are 10 billion neurons in the brain that store information. Electrical impulses flow
through a neuron and are moved by neuron-transmitting chemicals across the synaptic
gap between neurons. Neurons in the brain re every time we repeat a word, phrase,
song, or phone number we are trying to memorize. Memories are stored as patterns
of connections between neurons. When two neurons are activated, the connections
between them are strengthened.
If we repeat the information enough times, the neurons form a ring trace. Once the
trace is formed, then just starting the sequence triggers the rest of the items and allows
us to retrieve the memory. This is why we need to hear information over and over to
make it stick.

THE POWER OF A SCHEMA
If I ask you to describe what a “head” is, you might talk about the brain, hair, eyes, nose,
ears, skin, neck, and other parts. A head is
made up of many things, but you’ve gathered
all that information together and called it
“head.” Similarly I could talk about the “eye.”
You would think about all the things that make
up an eye: the eyeball, iris, eyelash, eyelid,
and so on. The head is a schema. The eye
is a schema. People use schemata (plural
for schema) to store information in long-term
memory and to retrieve it.
If people can connect new information
to information that is already stored, then it’s
easier to make it stick, or stay in long-term
memory, and easier to retrieve it. Schemata

them organize a lot of information (Figure 21.1).

  

21

PEOPLE HAVE TO USE INFORMATION TO MAKE IT STICK

55

EXPERTS STORE INFORMATION AS SCHEMATA

fi

The better people are at something, the more organized and powerful their schema
about it will be. For example, players who are new to the game of chess need a lot of
little schemata: the rst schema might be how to set up the pieces on the board, the
second might be how a queen can move, and so on. But expert chess players can pile
a lot of information into one schema with ease. They can look at a chessboard in the
middle of a game and tell you what
some of the starting moves were,
the strategies for each player, and
what the next move is likely to be.
They could certainly recite how
to set up the board and how each
piece can move. What would take
many schemata for novice players,
expert players can store in one
schema. This makes retrieval of
information faster and easier and
makes it easier for the expert to
put new information about chess
into long-term memory. The expert
can remember a lot of information
FIGURE 21.2 For experts, everything on the chessboard is in
one schema
as a single chunk (Figure 21.2).

Takeaways

Õ If you want people to remember something, then you have to go over it again and
again. Practice really does make perfect.

Õ One of the major reasons to do user or customer research is so that you can identify
and understand the schemata of your particular target audience.

Õ If people already have a schema that relates to information that you are providing,

make sure you point out what that schema is. It will be easier for them to learn and
remember the information if they can plug it into an existing schema.

56

HOW PEOPLE REMEMBER

22 IT’S EASIER TO RECOGNIZE

INFORMATION THAN RECALL IT

Remember the memory test at the start of this chapter? Without looking at the list, write
down as many of the words as you can. We’ll use this memory test to talk about recognition and recall.

RECOGNITION IS EASIER THAN RECALL

fi

fi

In the memory test at the beginning of this chapter, you memorized a list of words and
later wrote them down. This is called a recall task. If instead I had shown you a list of
words, or even walked you into an office and asked you which items were on the list, I
would have been giving you a recognition task. Recognition is easier than recall. Recognition makes use of context. And context can help you remember.
Many of the user interface tools and guidelines developed over the years help
reduce the memory load of using software and applications. Years ago there were no
dropdown list boxes with choices or elds that started to ll automatically as soon as you
started typing. These capabilities have improved the user experience of products primarily because they reduce the need for recall memory.

INCLUSION ERRORS
All the words you memorized were things related to an office. Look at what you wrote
down, and compare your list with the original list at the beginning of the chapter. You
probably wrote words that weren’t even in the original list but that go with the “office”
schema. For example, you might have written down “desk” or “pencil” or “boss.” Consciously or unconsciously, you were aware that the list included things associated with
an office. The schema probably helped you remember items on the list, but it might also
have caused you to make errors of inclusion.

Children make fewer inclusion errors
When children under age ve are shown items or pictures and then asked what they
remember, they actually make fewer errors of inclusion than adults because their schemata are not as well formed.

HOW PEOPLE REMEMBER

23 MEMORY TAKES A LOT OF MENTAL
RESOURCES

The latest research on unconscious mental processing shows that people receive 40
billion sensory inputs every second and are consciously aware of 40 at any one time.
Doesn’t this mean that we can deal with and remember more than four things at a time?
When you perceive a sensory input (for example, a sound, the feel of the wind on your
skin, a rock that is in front of you), you perceive that something exists. You don’t necessarily have to remember it or do something with the information. Conscious awareness
of 40 things is different than consciously processing 40 bits of information. It takes
a lot of mental resources to think about, remember, process, represent, and encode
information.

MEMORY IS EASILY DISRUPTED
fi

Imagine you’re listening to a presentation at a conference. When the presentation is
nished, you meet your friend in the lobby of the hotel. “What was the talk about?” she
asks. You’re most likely to remember what was seen and heard at the end of the talk.
This is called the recency effect.
If your phone vibrates during a presentation and you stop listening for a minute to
text someone, then you are most likely to remember the beginning of the presentation
and forget the ending. This is called the suffix effect.

Interesting facts about memory
You can store concrete words (table, chair) in long-term memory more easily than
abstract words (justice, democracy).
When you’re sad, you tend to remember sad things.
You can’t remember much before the age of three.
You can remember things that you see (visual memory) better than you can
remember words.

MEMORY TAKES A LOT OF MENTAL RESOURCES

59

N

We sleep and dream so we will remember
Some of the best research happens through serendipity. In 1991 neuroscientist Matthew
Wilson was studying brain activity in rats as they ran mazes. One day he accidentally
left the rats hooked up to the equipment he used to record their brain activity. The rats
eventually fell asleep. To his surprise he found that their brain activity was almost the
same whether they were sleeping or running mazes.

fi

Daoyun Ji and Wilson (2007) started a series of experiments to study this further. Their
experiments have led them to a theory, not just about rats but about people too: when
people sleep and dream, they are reworking, or consolidating, their experiences from
the day. Speci cally, they are consolidating new memories and making new associations
from the information they processed during the day. Their brains are deciding what to
remember and what to forget.

N

Why rhymes are easier to remember
Phonological (sound of words) coding can help retrieve information. Before there was
written language, stories were memorized and retold in rhyming verse. The activation
of one line in a verse more easily triggers the next verse. For example, you may have
learned “Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November.” This is an example of
phonological coding.

Takeaways

Õ Use concrete terms and icons. They will be easier to remember than abstract ideas
or images.

Õ Let people rest (and even sleep) if you want them to remember information. If you are

HOW PEOPLE REMEMBER

24 PEOPLE RECONSTRUCT MEMORIES

EACH TIME THEY REMEMBER THEM
fi

Think back to a particular event that happened at least ve years ago. Maybe it was a
wedding, a family gathering, a dinner with friends, or a vacation. Remember the people
and where you were. Maybe you can remember the weather or what you were wearing.

MEMORIES CHANGE

fi

fi

fi

fi

When you think about this event, it probably plays in your mind like a short movie clip.
Because you experience memories this way, you tend to think that memories are stored
in their entirety and never change, like an archived movie. But that’s not what happens.
Memories are actually reconstructed every time we think of them. They’re not movie
clips that are stored in the brain in a certain location, like les on a hard drive. They are
nerve pathways that re anew each time we remember the event. This makes for some
interesting effects. For example, the memory can change each time it is retrieved.
Events that occur after the original event can change the memory of the original
event. At the original event, you and your cousin were close friends. But later on you
have an argument and a falling-out that lasts for years. Over time when you recall the
memory of the rst event, it changes without you realizing it. It starts to include your
cousin being aloof and cold, even if that is not true. The later experience has changed
your memory.
You’ll also start to ll in memory gaps with made-up sequences of events, but these
will seem as real to you as the original event. You can’t remember who else was at the
family dinner, but Aunt Jolene is usually present at these events, and so over time your
memory of the event will include Aunt Jolene, even if she wasn’t there.

WHY EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES ARE UNRELIABLE

24

  

In her research on reconstructive memory, Elizabeth Loftus (1974) showed participants
a video clip of an automobile accident. Then she asked a series of questions about the
accident and substituted critical words. For example, she might ask, ”How fast would
you estimate the car was going when it hit the other vehicle?” or ”How fast would you
estimate the car was going when it smashed the other vehicle?” And she asked the participants if they remembered seeing broken glass.
Notice the difference in using the word “hit” versus “smashed.” When Loftus used
the word “smashed,” the estimated speed was higher than when she used the word
“hit.” And more than twice as many people remembered seeing broken glass if the word

PEOPLE RECONSTRUCT MEMORIES EACH TIME THEY REMEMBER THEM

61

“smashed” was used rather than the word “hit.” In later research Loftus was even able to
inject memories of events that never happened.

N

Ask witnesses to close their eyes during recall
If witnesses close their eyes while trying to remember what they saw, their memories are
clearer and more accurate (Perfect, 2008).

N

Memories can, indeed, be erased
Did you see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? It’s a movie about a business that
erases particular memories. It turns out that is possible. Research by scientists at Johns
Hopkins (Roger Clem, 2010) shows that memories can actually be erased.

THE IMPACT OF RECONSTRUCTED MEMORIES ON USER RESEARCH
Because we know that long-term memory might be faulty, it’s important that you watch
out for bias effects when you are conducting user research. It’s better to observe what
users do rather than ask them what they did in the past. And you need to be careful
how you word your interview questions. The words you use may affect the response
you get.

Takeaways

Õ Choose your language carefully when you’re getting feedback from your customers

or users about a product. The words you use can affect what people “remember” and
how they respond.

Õ Don’t rely entirely on self-reports of past behavior. People will not always remember
accurately what they or others did or said.

Õ Take what people say after the fact—when they are remembering using your product,
for instance, or remembering the experience of calling your customer service line—
with a grain of salt.

25 IT’S A GOOD THING THAT
PEOPLE FORGET

fi

Forgetting things seems to be such a problem. At best it’s annoying (“Where did I put
my keys?”), and at worst it can send the wrong people to prison with inaccurate eyewitness testimonies. How could something so maladaptive have developed in humans?
Why are we so flawed?
It’s actually not a flaw. Think about all the sensory inputs and experiences you have
every minute, every day, every year, and throughout your lifetime. If you remembered
every single thing, you’d be unable to function; you have to forget some things. Your
brain is constantly deciding what to remember and what to forget. It doesn’t always make
decisions that you nd helpful, but in general, the decisions it makes (primarily unconsciously) are keeping you alive!

A FORMULA TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH YOU WILL FORGET
In 1886, Hermann Ebbinghaus created a formula showing the degradation of memories:
R = e(−t/s)
where R is memory retention, S is the relative strength of memory, and t is time.
The formula results in a graph that looks like Figure 25.1. It’s called the forgetting
curve, and it shows that we quickly forget information unless it’s stored in long-term
memory.

DESIGN WITH FORGETTING IN MIND

fi

Don’t assume that people will remember information. Provide the information that people need or an easy way to look it up.
Before option buttons and dropdown menus were available, most software made
large demands on users to remember what data could be entered into a eld. Now there
are user interface elements—like option buttons and dropdown menus—that relieve the
memory load and help people forget less often.
Figure 25.2 shows a typical situation in which a dropdown list box will help people
remember what the options are.

FIGURE 25.2 Dropdown menus help relieve memory load and minimize forgetting

Takeaways

Õ People are always going to forget.
Õ What people forget is not a conscious decision.
Õ Design with forgetting in mind. When information is really important, don’t rely on peofi

ple to remember it. Provide it for them in your design or have a way for them to easily
look it up. For example, use dropdown list boxes to show choices rather than assuming
users will remember what to ll in.

HOW PEOPLE REMEMBER

26 THE MOST VIVID MEMORIES
ARE WRONG

fi

If you are at least 30 years old and I asked you to recall where you were and what you
were doing when you rst heard about the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York
City, chances are very good that you could tell me about that day in great detail. If you
live in the U.S., and you were age 10 or older on that date, your memory would likely
include details such as how you heard about the attacks, who you were with, and what
you did the rest of that day. But research shows that a lot of, perhaps even most of, your
memories would be wrong.

FLASHBULB MEMORIES ARE VIVID
Remembering traumatic or dramatic events in great detail is called flashbulb memory.
Emotions are processed in the amygdala, which is very close to the hippocampus,
which is involved in the long-term coding of information into memories. So it’s no
surprise to psychologists that emotionally laden memories might be very strong and
remembered vividly.

VIVID BUT FULL OF ERRORS
Although flashbulb memories are vivid, they are also full of errors. In 1986 the space
shuttle Challenger exploded. If you are old enough to recall that event, you probably remember it vividly. The day after this tragic event, Ulric Neisser, a professor who
researches memories like these, had his students write down their memories of what
had happened. Three years later he asked them to write their memory of the event
again (Neisser, 1992). Over 90 percent of the later reports differed from the originals.
Half of them were inaccurate in two-thirds of the details. One person, when shown the
description she had written three years earlier, said, “I know that’s my handwriting, but I
couldn’t possibly have written that.” Similar research has been conducted on individuals
with memories of the 9/11 attacks, with similar results.
The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve showed that memories degrade quickly over time.
Because flashbulb memories are so vivid, it was thought that perhaps they were not as
subject to forgetting as other memories. But it turns out they are. That’s kind of disturbing
when you think about it. Because these memories are so vivid, we tend to think they are
more true. But we are wrong.

Takeaways

Õ Dramatic or traumatic experiences will be remembered more vividly and more certainly
than other types of memories.

Õ Most of these dramatic or traumatic experiences will be remembered incorrectly.
Õ No matter how certain people are of their memories of events, you need to assume
that most long-term memories are not completely accurate.

Õ If you are interviewing people and requiring them to remember events, keep in mind
that what they say happened may be inaccurate.

HOW

PEOPLE
THINK

The brain has 23 billion neurons. That’s a lot of capacity for mental processing. So what’s going on in there?
Understanding how people think is crucial if you’re going to
design for them. Just as there are visual illusions, there are also
thinking illusions. This chapter describes some of the interesting
things the brain does as it makes sense of the world.

27 PEOPLE PROCESS INFORMATION
-

BETTER IN BITE SIZED CHUNKS

The brain can process only small amounts of information at a time—consciously, that is.
(The estimate is that you handle 40 billion pieces of information every second, but only
40 of those make it to your conscious brain.) One mistake that designers sometimes
make is giving too much information all at once.

APPLYING THE CONCEPT OF PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE
Progressive disclosure means providing only the information people need at the moment
and letting them click to learn more about specific topics as they want or need to.
If you don’t use progressive disclosure, you will end up with very long pages of information that may overwhelm your reader.
Take, for example, this page from the United States Social Security website. This is a
section on benefits planning for survivors. The page is very long and has no progressive
disclosure (Figures 27.1, 27.2, 27.3).

FIGURE 27.1 The first screen of the page

68

HOW PEOPLE THINK

FIGURE 27.2 Scrolling down, still on the same page

FIGURE 27.3 Scrolling even more, still on the same
page

In fact, the reader needs to navigate through seven screens to finish the page. If the
page had included progressive disclosure, then each topic could have been summarized
in one or two sentences. The reader can then click or tap for more information. This is
especially appropriate for the type of information on this page, because it is likely that
only some of these sections apply to any one individual.

COUNTING CLICKS ISN’T WHAT COUNTS
Progressive disclosure requires multiple clicks. You may have heard it said that you
should minimize the number of times that people have to click to get to detailed information. The number of clicks is not the important metric. People are very willing to click
multiple times. In fact, they won’t even notice they’re clicking if they’re getting the right
amount of information at each click to keep them going down the path. Think progressive disclosure; don’t count clicks.

KNOW WHO NEEDS WHAT WHEN

27

  

Progressive disclosure is a great technique, but it assumes that you know what most
people want most of the time. If you haven’t done your research on that, then you could

PEOPLE PROCESS INFORMATION BETTER IN BITE-SIZED CHUNKS

69

end up with a frustrating site, with most people having to spend a lot of time searching
for the information they are looking for. Progressive disclosure works only if you know
what most people will be looking for at each part of the path.

A great book about designing interfaces that don’t require people to think too much is
Steve Krug’s Don’t Make Me Think.

N

The origins of progressive disclosure

fi

fi

The term progressive disclosure was rst used by J.M. Keller. Keller is a professor of
instructional design, and in the early 1980s he came up with an instructional design
model called Attention, Relevance, Con dence, and Satisfaction (ARCS). Progressive
disclosure is part of the ARCS model: present only the information the learner needs at
that moment.

Takeaways

Õ Use progressive disclosure. Show people what they need when they need it. Build in
links for them to get more information.

Õ If you have to make a trade-off on clicks versus thinking, use more clicks and less
thinking.

Õ Before you use progressive disclosure, make sure you have done your research and
know what most people want and when they want it.

28 SOME TYPES OF MENTAL

PROCESSING ARE MORE
CHALLENGING THAN OTHERS

Imagine you’re paying bills on your banking website. You have to think about what bills
need to be paid when, look up your balance, decide how much to pay on your credit
cards, and click the right buttons to get the payments processed. As you do this task,
there are things you’re thinking about and remembering (cognitive), things you’re looking at on the screen (visual), and buttons you are pressing, mouse movements, and typing (motor).
In human factors terminology, these are called loads. The theory is that there are
basically three different kinds of demands or loads that you can make on a person: cognitive (including memory), visual, and motor.

ALL LOADS ARE NOT EQUAL
Each load uses up a different amount of mental resources. You use up more resources
when you ask people to look at something or find something on a screen (visual)
than when you ask them to press a button or move a mouse (motor). You use up more
by asking them to think or remember or do a mental calculation (cognitive) than when
you ask them to look at something on a screen (visual). So from a human factors point
of view, the order of the loads from most “expensive” to least is:

MAKING TRADE-OFFS

28

  

From a human factors point of view, when you’re designing a product, application, or
website, you’re always making trade-offs. If you have to add a few clicks but it means
the person doesn’t have to think or remember as much, that’s worth it, because adding
clicks is less of a load than thinking. I once did some research on this topic. People had
to go through more than 10 clicks to get the task done, and at the end they would look
up and smile and say, “That was easy!” because each step was logical and gave them
what they expected. They didn’t have to think. Clicking is less of a load than thinking.

SOME TYPES OF MENTAL PROCESSING ARE MORE CHALLENGING THAN OTHERS

71

USE FITTS’S LAW TO DETERMINE MOTOR LOADS
Although motor loads are the least “expensive” of the three loads, you often want to
reduce them. One way to reduce the motor load is to make sure that the targets you’re
asking people to hit aren’t too small or too far away—for example, when you ask them to
move a mouse across a screen and click a button or a small arrow on a dropdown box
to show a list of choices.
There is actually a formula that can be used to figure out how large a target should
be to enable someone to reach it reliably while moving a mouse across the screen. It’s
called Fitts’s law. The formula is shown in Figure 28.1.

(

T = a + b log2 1 +

D
W

)

FIGURE 28.1 The formula for Fitts’s law

7

T is the average time taken to complete the movement (sometimes called MT
for movement time).

7

a is the start/stop time of the device (intercept), and b stands for the inherent
speed of the device (slope).

7
7

D is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target.
W is the width of the target measured along the axis of motion.

I don’t expect you to go calculate Fitts’s law, but I include it here so that you realize
that there is a scientific way to determine how large a button or arrow should be.
The basic idea to keep in mind is that there is a relationship between speed, accuracy, and distance. For example, let’s say that you have a small arrow on the bottom right
of the screen and the user has to move the mouse from the top left to the bottom right to
click the small arrow. Fitts’s law tells us that they will probably overshoot the arrow if they
move quickly, and they’ll have to back up and go to the arrow.

N

Minimize motor switching
One type of motor load is when people have to switch back and forth between a keyboard and a mouse or trackpad. This is especially true of people who are doing “heads
down” data entry. If someone is typing or entering data from paper, and they do it a lot
and are very skilled, chances are they are not looking at anything but the paper (hence
the term “heads down”). In this case it can be distracting to move from keyboard to
mouse. If possible, keep people on the keyboard or with the mouse as long as possible
and minimize the switching.

72

HOW PEOPLE THINK

SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO INCREASE LOADS
Most of the time when we consider loads in design, we’re looking to reduce the loads
(especially cognitive and visual) to make the product easier to use. But sometimes you
want to increase the load. For example, to grab someone’s attention you might add
visual information (pictures, animation, video) and thereby increase the visual load of the
product.
The best example of purposely increasing loads is gaming. A game is an interface in
which one or more of the loads have been intentionally increased to provide a challenge.
Some games have high cognitive loads because you have to figure out what’s going on.
Some have high visual loads, where you have to find things on the screen. Some have
high motor loads, where you have to use the keyboard or a separate device to move the
cursor or “shoot” the villains. Many games increase more than one load—for example,
when a game has both visual and motor challenges.

Takeaways

Õ Evaluate the loads of an existing product to see if you should reduce one or more of
the loads to make it easier to use.

Õ When you design a product, remember that making people think or remember (cognitive load) requires the most mental resources.

Õ Look for trade-offs (for example, where you can reduce a cognitive load by increasing
a visual or motor load).

28

  

Õ Make sure your motor targets are large enough to be easily reached.

29 MINDS WANDER 30 PERCENT
OF THE TIME

You’re at work reading a report that a colleague has written and you realize that you’ve
just read the same sentence three times. Instead of thinking about what you were reading, your mind wandered.
Mind wandering is similar to but not the same as daydreaming. Psychologists use
daydreaming to refer to any stray thoughts, fantasies, or stories you imagine—for example, winning the lottery or being a celebrity. Mind wandering is more specific: it refers to
doing one task and then fading into thinking about something unrelated to that task.

MIND WANDERING IS A VERY COMMON PHENOMENON
People underestimate mind wandering; according to Jonathan Schooler of the University of California, Santa Barbara, people think their minds are wandering about 10 percent of the time—but it’s actually much more than that. During everyday activities, our
minds wander up to 30 percent of the time, and in some cases, such as driving on an
uncrowded highway, it might be as much as 70 percent.

N

Wandering minds annoy neuroscientists
Some neuroscientists became interested in studying wandering minds because they
were such an annoyance while doing brain scan research (Mason, 2007). The researchers would have subjects perform a certain task (for example, look at a picture or read a
passage) while scanning for brain activity. About 30 percent of the time there would be
extraneous results that seemed unrelated to the task at hand. That’s because the subject’s mind was wandering from the task at hand. Eventually researchers decided to start
studying the wandering mind rather than just get annoyed by it.

WHY A WANDERING MIND CAN BE A GOOD THING
Mind wandering allows one part of the brain to focus on the task at hand, and another
part of the brain to keep a higher goal in mind. For example, while driving you’re paying attention to the road, but you’re also thinking about when to stop for gas. Or you
are reading an article online about a cholesterol medication that your doctor thinks you
should take, but your mind wanders to the idea that you should put that haircut on your

74

HOW PEOPLE THINK

calendar. Mind wandering might be the closest thing we have to multitasking. It’s not
really multitasking (see the “How People Focus Their Attention” chapter for more information on multitasking), but mind wandering does allow you to switch focus from one
idea to another and then back again quickly.

WHY A WANDERING MIND CAN BE A BAD THING
Much of the time when your mind wanders, you’re unaware of it. This means that you
can miss important information. For example, if you are supposed to be reading that
report from your colleague but you are instead thinking about what to make for dinner,
that may just mean you are being unproductive.

8

More mind wandering equals more creativity
Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara (Christoff, 2009), have evidence that people whose minds wander a lot are more creative and better problem solvers. Their brains have them working on the task at hand but simultaneously processing
other information and making connections.

Takeaways

Õ People will focus on a task for only a limited time. Assume that their minds are wandering often.

Õ If possible, use hyperlinks to grab onto this idea of quickly switching from topic to topic.
People like having more link options because it enables this type of wandering.

Õ Make sure you build in feedback about where people are so that if they wander, it’s

29

  

easier for them to get back to the original location or go to the next.

30 THE MORE UNCERTAIN PEOPLE
ARE, THE MORE THEY DEFEND
THEIR IDEAS

Several years ago I was a loyal iPhone user. I wasn’t always an Apple fan; I used to be
a Windows/PC person. Realize that I go all the way back to when PCs first came out.
I used to have a marvelous “portable” PC that ran on a CPM operating system and had
two (count ’em, two) 360 KB (yes, I said KB) floppy disk drives (in other words, no hard
drive). I was a PC person, not an Apple person. Apples were for teachers and then later
for artsy people. That was not me.
But I became an Apple convert over a few years in the early 2000s. (I describe the
story of how I changed my loyalty from PCs to Apple in my book Neuro Web Design:
What Makes Them Click? It’s a matter of starting with small changes and commitments
and then growing to more loyalty.)
Perhaps you might be able to guess what happened when I went to dinner with a
colleague who was showing me his Android phone. He loved his new Android phone
and wanted to show me all the ways it was as good as, or better than, my iPhone. I was
totally uninterested in hearing about it. I didn’t even want to look at it. Basically, I didn’t
want to allow into my brain any information that would conflict with my opinion that nothing besides an iPhone was even a possibility. I was showing classic symptoms of cognitive dissonance denial. (As of this writing I have to report that I did eventually switch to
Android, and even back to Windows/PC, but that’s another story!)

ALTER OUR BELIEFS OR DENY THE INFORMATION?
In 1956 Leon Festinger wrote a book called When Prophecy Fails. In it he describes the
idea of cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is the uncomfortable feeling you
get when you have two ideas that conflict with each other. You don’t like the feeling, so
you’ll try to get rid of the dissonance. There are two main ways you can do that: change
your belief or deny one of the ideas.

When forced, people will change their beliefs
In the original research on cognitive dissonance, people were forced to defend an
opinion that they did not believe in. The result was that people tended to change their
beliefs to fit the new idea.
In research by Vincent Van Veen (2009), he had people “argue” that the fMRI scan
experience was pleasant (it’s not). When “forced” to make statements that the experience
was pleasant, certain parts of the brain showed as active (the dorsal anterior cingulate

76

HOW PEOPLE THINK

cortex and the anterior insular cortex). The more these regions were activated, the more
the participant would claim that he or she really did think the fMRI was pleasant.

When not forced, people dig in
There’s another reaction that sometimes occurs. What if you are not forced to state that
you believe something you don’t; what if instead you are presented with information that
opposes your beliefs, but you are not forced to espouse a new belief? In these situations the tendency is to deny the new information instead of changing your belief to fit.

If uncertain, people will argue harder
David Gal and Derek Rucker (2010) conducted research in which they used framing techniques to make people feel uncertain. (For example, they told one group to
remember a time when they were full of certainty, and the other group to remember
a time when they were full of doubt.) Then they asked the participants whether they
were meat-eaters, vegetarians, vegans, or otherwise, how important this was to them,
and how confident they were in their opinions. People who were asked to remember a
time of uncertainty were less confident of their eating choices. However, when asked
to write up their beliefs to persuade someone else to eat the way they did, they would
write more and stronger arguments than those who were certain of their choice. Gal
and Rucker performed the research with different topics (for example, preferences for
a Mac versus a PC computer) and found similar results. When people were less certain,
they would dig in and argue even harder.

ASK FOR SMALL COMMITMENTS
Let’s say that you have designed a landing page hoping that visitors will purchase your
product or service. The problem is you may not know whether people coming to the page
are ready to buy or whether they are uncertain or perhaps even downright skeptical.
The best tactic to use, therefore, might be to ask for a small commitment rather than
a large one. This is why free trials work so well. It’s a small commitment to sign up for a
seven-day free trial and will therefore make it less likely for someone to have a strong
reaction and dig in their heels against your product or service.

Takeaways

Õ The best way to change a belief is to get someone to commit to something very small.
Õ Don’t just give people evidence that their belief is not logical, tenable, or a good
choice. This may backfire and make them dig in even harder.

PEOPLE CREATE MENTAL MODELS

Imagine that you’ve never seen a Kindle, but I’ve just handed you one and told you that
you can read books on it. Before you turn on the Kindle, before you use it, you have a
model in your head of what reading a book on the device will be like. You have assumptions about what the book will look like on the screen, what things you will be able to
do, and how you will do them—things like turning a page or using a bookmark. You have
a mental model of reading a book on the Kindle, even if you’ve never done it before.
What that mental model in your head looks and acts like depends on many things.
If you’ve used an electronic device to read a book before, your mental model of reading a book on a Kindle will be different from that of someone who has only read physical books. And once you get the Kindle and read a couple of books on it, whichever
mental model you had in your head before will start to change and adjust to reflect your
experience.
I’ve been talking about mental models (and their counterparts, conceptual models,
discussed in the following section) since the 1980s. I’ve been designing interfaces for
software, websites, medical devices, and various products for many years. I always enjoy
the challenge of matching what’s going on in people’s brains with the constraints and
opportunities presented by technology. Interface environments come and go (for example, the green screen of character-based systems, or the blue screen of early graphical
user interfaces), but people change more slowly. Some of the age-old user interface
design concepts are still extremely relevant and important. Mental models and conceptual models are some of the most useful design concepts that I believe have passed the
test of time.

N

The origin of the term mental models
fi

The rst person to talk about mental models was Kenneth Craik in his 1943 book, The
Nature of Explanation. Shortly thereafter, Craik died in a bicycle accident, and the concept went dormant for many years. It reappeared in the 1980s, when two books were
published with the title Mental Models, one by Philip Johnson-Laird and the other by
Dedre Gentner.

WHAT EXACTLY IS A MENTAL MODEL?
A mental model is a collection of thought processes and memories about how something works. Mental models drive behavior. They direct us to pay attention to some
things and ignore others, and they influence how we solve problems.

78

HOW PEOPLE THINK

In the field of design, a mental model refers to the representation of something—
the real world, a device, software, and so on—that a person has in mind. People create mental models very quickly, often before they even use the software or device.
Their mental models come from their prior experience with similar software or devices,
assumptions they have, things they’ve heard others say, and also their direct experience with the product or device. Mental models are subject to change. People refer to
mental models to predict what the system, software, or product is going to do, or what
they should do with it.

Takeaways

Õ People always have a mental model.
Õ People get their mental models from past experience.
Õ Not everyone has the same mental model.
Õ An important reason for doing user or customer research is so you can understand the

79

32 PEOPLE INTERACT WITH
CONCEPTUAL MODELS

To understand why mental models are so important to design, you also have to understand what a conceptual model is and how it differs from a mental model. A mental
model is the representation that people have about a product they are interacting with.
A conceptual model is the actual model that is given to the person through the design
and interface of the actual product. Going back to the Kindle example, you have a mental model of what reading a book will be like using a Kindle, how it will work, and what
you can do with it. But when you sit down with the Kindle, the “system” (the Kindle) displays what the conceptual model of that book app actually is. There will be screens and
buttons and things that happen. The actual interface is the conceptual model. Someone
designed an interface, and that interface is communicating to you the conceptual model
of the product.
At this point you might be asking, “So? Why should I care about this mental model/
conceptual model idea?” Here’s why you should care: if there is a mismatch between the
person’s mental model and the product’s conceptual model, then the product or website
or app will be hard to learn, hard to use, or rejected. How do mismatches occur? Here
are some examples:

7

The designers thought they knew who would be using the interface and
how much experience they had with interfaces like this, and they designed
according to those assumptions without testing them. It turns out their
assumptions were wrong.

7

The audience or the product is varied. The designers designed for one persona or type of audience, and the mental model and conceptual model match
for that group but not for others.

7

There are no real designers. The conceptual model wasn’t really designed at
all. It’s just a reflection of the underlying hardware or software or database, so
the only people whose mental model it fits are the programmers. If the audience is not the programmers, then you’re in trouble.

WHAT IF IT’S BRAND NEW AND I PURPOSELY WANT A MISMATCH?
What about the idea that people who have only read real, physical books will not have
an accurate mental model of reading books on a Kindle? In this case you know that
people will not have an accurate mental model that fits. You want to change their mental
model.

80

HOW PEOPLE THINK

Sometimes you know that the mental model of the target audience will not fit the conceptual model, and instead of changing the design of the interface, you want to change
people’s mental model to match the conceptual model you’ve designed. The way to
change a mental model is through training. You can use a short training video to change
their mental model before the Kindle even arrives at their door. In fact, one of the best
purposes of training on a new product is to adjust the audience’s mental model to fit the
conceptual model of the product.

Takeaways

Õ Design the conceptual model purposefully. Don’t let it “bubble up” from the
technology.

Õ The secret to designing an intuitive user experience is making sure that the conceptual
model of your product matches, as much as possible, the mental model of your audience. If you get that right, you will have created a positive and useful experience.

Õ If you have a brand new product that you know will not match anyone’s mental model,
you’ll need to provide training to prepare people to create a new mental model.

IN STORY FORM

One day, many years ago, I found myself in front of a classroom full of user interface
designers who did not want to be there. Their boss had told them they had to attend
the workshop I was giving. I knew that many or most of them thought the class was a
waste of time, and knowing that was making me nervous. I decided to be brave and
forge ahead. Certainly my great content would grab their attention, right? I took a deep
breath, smiled, and with a strong voice, I started the session with a big, “Hello, everyone. I’m certainly glad to be here.” More than half the class wasn’t even looking at me.
They were reading their email. One guy had the morning newspaper open and was
reading that. It was one of those moments where seconds seem like hours.
I thought to myself in a panic, “What am I going to do?” Then I had an idea. “Let me
tell you a story,” I said. At the word story everyone’s head jerked up and all eyes were on
me. I knew I only had a few seconds to start a story that would hold their attention.
“It was 1988 and a team of Navy officers were staring at a computer screen. Something had just appeared on the radar in protected air space. They had orders to shoot
down any unknown aircraft. Was this an unknown aircraft? Was it a military plane? Was
it a commercial airliner? They had two minutes to decide what to do.” I had them! Everyone was interested and riveted. I finished the story, which nicely made my point about
why they should care about designing usable interfaces that avoid user uncertainty, and
we were off to a great start. The rest of the day flew by, everyone was interested and
engaged, and I got some of my best teacher evaluations ever. Now I make sure to use
that magic phrase, “Let me tell you a story,” at least once in every talk I give or class I
teach.
You may have realized that what I did in the previous paragraph was tell a story. Stories are very powerful. They grab and hold attention. But they do more than that. They
also help people process information, and they imply causation.

TRIED-AND-TRUE STORY FORMATS
Aristotle identified the basic structure of stories, and many people have expounded on
his ideas since. One model is the basic three-act structure: beginning, middle, and end.
This may not sound very unusual, but when Aristotle came up with it over two thousand
years ago it was probably pretty radical.
In the beginning you introduce your audience to the setting, the characters, and the
situation or conflict. In the previous story I introduced you to the setting (I had to give a
class), the characters (me and students), and the conflict (the students don’t want to be
there).

82

HOW PEOPLE THINK

My story was very short, so the middle part was short too. In the middle part of a
story, there are typically obstacles and conflicts that the main character has to overcome.
These are usually somewhat resolved, but not completely resolved. In my story the main
character tried her usual opening and it failed. Then she started to panic.
At the end of the story the conflict comes to a climax and then is resolved. In my story
I thought of what to do (tell a story to the class), which I did and which succeeded.
This is just a basic outline. There are many variations and plots that can be added
and woven in.

CLASSIC STORIES
There are many stories that appear over and over in literature and in movies. Here are
some of the popular themes that have been identified:

STORIES IMPLY CAUSATION
Stories may create causation when none is there. Because stories usually involve some
form of chronological narrative (first this happened, next this happened), they imply causation even if none exists. Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons give this example in
their book The Invisible Gorilla (2010). Look at these two passages:
Joey’s big brother punched him again and again. The next day his body
was covered by bruises.
Joey’s crazy mother became furiously angry with him. The next day his
body was covered by bruises.

33

  

In the first passage you don’t need to assume much. Joey got punched, and he has
bruises. He got the bruises from being punched. In the second passage the inference
is not quite so clear. Research shows that your brain will actually take a little bit longer
to ponder the second paragraph. Yet most people will conclude that Joey has bruises
because of his mother, even though the passage doesn’t say that. In fact, if you ask
people later to remember the passage, they will believe that they read in the story that
Joey’s mother actually hit him, even though that is not what the paragraph says.

PEOPLE PROCESS INFORMATION BEST IN STORY FORM

83

People are quick to assign causality. Just as the visual cortex is filling in what you see
to find and detect patterns (see the “How People See” chapter), our thought processes
do the same thing. You are always looking for causation. Your brain assumes you have
been given all the pertinent information and that there is causation. Stories make it even
easier to make this causal leap.

STORIES ARE IMPORTANT IN ALL COMMUNICATIONS
Sometimes clients say to me, “Stories are fine for some situations, but not the one I’m
working on now. I’m designing a website for the company’s annual report. Stories aren’t
appropriate there; it’s just financial information.” Not true. There are appropriate stories
you can use anytime you are trying to communicate.
A medical technology company I worked with uses stories in their annual reports. For
example, on the cover of one of the annual reports they showed a photo of a patient who
was helped by one of their products. Later in the report there was a short story about the
patient (we’ll call her Maureen):
“Maureen Showalter, shown here and on the cover, had such a severe lumbar scoliosis that the pain incapacitated her, and the deformity was progressively getting worse.
Then she underwent spinal fusion surgery using our spinal products to correct the alignment. Today, Maureen’s spine is much straighter, her pain is virtually gone, and she is
several inches taller.”
Maureen’s was not the only story in the annual report. Sprinkled in with the financial
information were high-quality photos as well as stories about people like Maureen and
about employees who invented various technologies. The stories make the rest of the
information in the report more interesting and also create a link between the financial
numbers and the stated mission of the company.

Takeaways

Õ Stories are the natural way people process information.
Õ Use a story if you want people to make a causal leap.
Õ Stories aren’t just for fun. No matter how dry you think your information is or should be,
using stories will make it understandable, interesting, and memorable.

EXAMPLES

Let’s say you’re a marketing person and you want to email your customers about a new
product offering. You bring up a web page that has directions on how to build an email
campaign using the email software service your company has subscribed to:
1.

From the Dashboard or the Campaign tab click the “Create Campaign” button
and select the type of campaign you’d like to create.

2. Next select the list you’d like to send to. Once you’ve selected the list, use
the “next” option to move forward, or click “send to entire list.”
3. Next name your campaign, set up a subject line, set the from name reply-to
email, and personalize your “To:” field with *|MERGETAGS|*. You will also find
your options for tracking, authentication, analytics tracking, and social sharing. (Use the “next” and “back” options to navigate through the steps [not
your browser’s back button].)
4. Select a template for your email. Templates you’ve set up and saved are in
“my templates.” If you’re providing your own code, use the “paste/import
HTML” or “import from URL” options. If you want to create an editable (or noneditable) template for your clients, choose “code custom templates.”
5. Once you choose your template you next use the content editor to edit your
styles and content. Click “show style editor” to bring up the style options.
6. You can edit the styles for each section. You can set the line height, font size,
and more for this section.
7.

Click anywhere inside the borders to open the content editor.

8. After you click Save, wait for your content to refresh; then click the “next”
option.
9. Send some test emails to several email addresses to see how the campaign
looks in your recipient’s inboxes. If everything looks good, you can schedule
or send out your campaign.

Screen shots or pictures are a good way to provide examples. You can also use videos that walk you through the same steps. Video is one of the most effective ways to
give examples online. Videos combine movement, sound, and vision, and don’t require
reading, so they are attention-getting and engaging.

Takeaways

Õ People learn best by example. Don’t just tell people what to do. Show them.
Õ Use pictures and screen shots to show by example.
Õ Better yet, use short videos as examples.

35 PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN TO CREATE
CATEGORIES

If you grew up with TV in the U.S. in the last 50 years, you probably know what I mean
if I say, “One of these things is not like the other.” This is a snippet from the popular children’s show Sesame Street.

8

Watch the Sesame Street video
If you don’t know what I am talking about, you can view YouTube clips. Here’s an
example: www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sgk-ZYxKxM.

The purpose of this Sesame Street lesson is to teach young children how to notice
differences and essentially how to start to learn to categorize.
Interestingly, it’s probably unnecessary, and perhaps even ineffective, to try to teach
children how to create categories, for two reasons:

7

People naturally create categories. Just as learning a native language happens naturally, so does learning to categorize the world around us.

7

Categorizing doesn’t emerge as a skill until about age seven. Thinking about
categories just doesn’t make sense to children before that. After age seven,
however, kids become fascinated with categorizing information.

PEOPLE LOVE TO CATEGORIZE

35

  

If you’ve ever conducted a card-sorting exercise while doing research for a product
design, then you’ve had the experience of watching how avidly people approach
the task. In card sorting, you typically give people a stack of cards. On each card is a
word or phrase about something they would find at the website or a task they might
do with the product you are designing. For example, if you’re designing a website that
sells camping equipment, then you might have a set of cards that say things like tents,
stoves, backpack, returns, shipping, help. You ask the people to arrange the cards into
whatever groups or categories make sense to them. Then you analyze the groupings
and have data from which to build the organization of your website. I’ve done this many
times, including using it as an exercise in classes I teach. It’s one of the most engaging
tasks I have people do. Everyone gets very involved in this exercise, because people

PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN TO CREATE CATEGORIES

87

like to create categories. The whole field of information architecture is about how to
organize information into categories.

IF YOU DON’T PROVIDE CATEGORIES, PEOPLE WILL CREATE
THEIR OWN
Just as the visual cortex imposes patterns on what we see, whether or not there are
really patterns there (see the “How People See” chapter), people will impose categories
when they’re confronted with large amounts of information. People use categorization
as a way to make sense of the world around them, especially when they feel overwhelmed with information.

WHO ORGANIZES IT DOESN’T MATTER AS MUCH AS HOW WELL
IT’S ORGANIZED

­

While working on my master’s thesis at Penn State, I conducted research on whether
people would remember information better if it was organized by other people or if
they organized it themselves. Basically what I found was that it didn’t really matter. What
mattered most was how well it was organized. The more organized the information,
the better people remembered it. Some people (those who measured high on “locus
of control” measures) preferred to organize the information in their own way, but selforganization versus other organization schemes didn’t really matter as long as the
information was well organized.

Takeaways

Õ People like to put things into categories.
Õ If there is a lot of information and it is not in categories, people will feel overwhelmed
and try to organize the information on their own.

Õ It’s always a good idea to organize information for your audience as much as possible.
Keep in mind the four-item rule from the “How People Remember” chapter.

Õ It’s useful to get input from people on what organization schemes make the most
sense to them, but the critical thing is that you organize the material.

Õ If you’re designing sites for children under age seven, any organization into categories
you are doing is probably more for the adults in that child’s world, not for the child.

88

HOW PEOPLE THINK

36 TIME IS RELATIVE
Has this ever happened to you? You’re traveling to visit friends. It’s two hours to get
there and two hours to get back, but the trip there feels much longer than the trip back.
In the interesting book The Time Paradox (2009), Philip Zimbardo and John Boyd
discuss how our experience of time is relative, not absolute. There are time illusions, just
like there are visual illusions. Zimbardo reports on research that shows that the more
mental processing you do, the more time you think has elapsed. Related to the concept
of progressive disclosure, discussed earlier in this chapter, if people have to stop and
think at each step of a task, they’ll feel that the task is taking too long. The mental processing makes the amount of time seem longer.
The perception of time and your reaction to it are also greatly influenced by predictability and expectations. Let’s say you’re editing video on your computer. You’ve just
clicked the button to produce the video file from your edits. Will you be frustrated by how
long it takes to produce the video? If you do this task often and it normally takes three
minutes, then three minutes will not seem like a long time. If there is a progress indicator,
then you know what to expect. You’ll go pour yourself a cup of coffee and come back.
But if it sometimes takes thirty seconds and sometimes takes five minutes, and you don’t
know which one it’s going to be this time, then you will be very frustrated if it takes three
minutes. Three minutes will seem much longer than it usually does.

IF PEOPLE FEEL PRESSED FOR TIME, THEY WON’T STOP TO
HELP SOMEONE
In the “Good Samaritan” research by John Darley and C. Batson (1973), Princeton seminary students were asked to prepare a speech on either jobs for seminary graduates
or the parable of the Good Samaritan. The parable is about several holy men who pass
someone in need but don’t stop to help. The Samaritan comes upon the person in need
and does stop and help him. In the research study, the seminary students were asked to
prepare their talks, and then they were told to go to a building across campus and give
the talk. The experimenter gave the participants different instructions, depending on
whether they were in the low hurry, intermediate hurry, or high hurry category:

7

Low hurry: “It’ll be a few minutes before they’re ready for you, but you might
as well head on over. If you have to wait over there, it shouldn’t be long.”

7
7

Intermediate hurry: “The assistant is ready for you, so please go right over.”
High hurry: “Oh, you’re late. They were expecting you a few minutes ago.
You’d better get moving. The assistant should be waiting for you so you’d better hurry. It should only take a minute.”

  

36

TIME IS RELATIVE

89

Each student was then given an index card with instructions about where to go. The
instructions took them past someone who was part of the experiment, and this person
was huddled and coughing and groaning in an alley on campus. The question was, how
many people would stop and offer help? Would it matter what talk they had been preparing to give? Would it matter what instructions they were given on whether to hurry or not?
What percentage of people stopped to help?

7
7
7

Low hurry: 63 percent
Intermediate hurry: 45 percent
High hurry: 10 percent

The type of talk the participants had prepared for ( jobs versus the Good Samaritan
parable) didn’t make a significant difference in whether they stopped to help, but how
much of a hurry they were in did.

EXPECTATIONS CHANGE OVER TIME
Ten years ago if it took twenty seconds for a website to load, we didn’t think much of it.
But these days if it takes more than three seconds, you get impatient. One website I go
to regularly takes twelve seconds to load. It seems like an eternity.

N

Time mechanisms in your body
Rao (2001) used fMRI images of the brain to show that two areas process information
about time: the basal ganglia (deep inside the brain where dopamine is stored) and the
parietal lobe (on the surface of the right side of the brain). Some time functions are also
built into each cell of the body.

Takeaways

Õ Always provide progress indicators so people know how long something will take.
Õ If possible, make consistent the amount of time it takes to do a task or bring up information so that people can adjust their expectations accordingly.

Õ To make a process seem shorter, break it up into steps and have people think less. It’s
mental processing that makes something seem to take a long time.

HOW PEOPLE THINK

37 PEOPLE SCREEN OUT INFORMATION
THAT DOESN’T FIT THEIR BELIEFS

37

  

Have you ever met someone who has a long-held belief that they just won’t change, no
matter how much evidence you show them that the belief is not tenable? People seek
out and pay attention to information and cues that confirm their beliefs. They don’t seek
out—in fact, they ignore or even discount—information that doesn’t support what they
already believe. This is called confirmation bias.
A confirmation bias is a type of “cognitive illusion.” People tend to pay attention to
what they already believe and filter out information that doesn’t fit with their opinions
and beliefs.
This can make it difficult to get someone to be willing to even read or listen to information that doesn’t fit what they already believe, much less to try out something new.
Is it possible to “get through” to people with information that may not fit their existing
biases? If you have a new idea, a new product, or a different way of doing a process, how
do you get people to even consider it?
One way is to start with something that they agree with. If you first provide information that they already believe, you have gotten through the first barrier. Don’t start with
the new idea; start by confirming an idea they already have.
For example, let’s say that you want people to consider a new way to purchase and
listen to music. If you are talking to an audience that loves the method they are using
now (perhaps they subscribe to a streaming service), don’t begin by telling them how
inferior their current streaming service is. Start by mentioning all the ways their current
service is great. They will nod along, and then you can start to talk about why they can
go to the next level with your product.
Another way to get past a confirmation bias is to get a small commitment to a new
belief and thereby cause cognitive dissonance, which we discussed in a different part of
this chapter.
So in the music-streaming example, you could see if you can get people to sign up
for a short trial for free. That is a small commitment. If they find out they enjoy the service,
now they have cognitive dissonance: they enjoy the service, but the service doesn’t fit
their beliefs about the best way to listen to music. With that crack in the belief, they are
more likely to let the confirmation bias go.

PEOPLE SCREEN OUT INFORMATION THAT DOESN’T FIT THEIR BELIEFS

91

Takeaways

Õ Most people operate with confirmation biases. They filter out information that doesn’t
agree with beliefs they already hold.

Õ Telling people they are wrong, or pointing out the fact that they are doing the filtering,
is usually not a great strategy for overcoming cognitive biases.

Õ If you know your target audience and you know what their beliefs are, you can start by
speaking to those beliefs rather than against them. This allows you to get past a first
layer of confirmation bias, and then you can start to point out a different or better way
that might go against a current belief.

Õ Try to get a small commitment to an action that goes against the confirming belief. This
will stimulate cognitive dissonance and then you have a chance to break down the
cognitive bias.

38 PEOPLE CAN BE IN A FLOW STATE
Imagine you’re engrossed in some activity. It could be something physical like rock
climbing or skiing, something artistic or creative like playing the piano or painting, or
just an everyday activity like working on a PowerPoint presentation or teaching a class.
Whatever the activity, you become totally engrossed, totally in the moment. Everything
else falls away, your sense of time changes, and you almost forget who you are and
where you are. What I’m describing is called a flow state.
The man who wrote the book on flow is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He’s been studying the flow state around the world for many years. Here are some facts about the flow
state, the conditions that produce it, what it feels like, and how to apply the concept to
your designs:

7

The flow state occurs when people have very focused attention on a task.
The ability to control and focus attention is critical. If people get distracted by
anything outside the activity they’re engaging in, the flow state will dissipate.
If you want people to be in a flow state while using your product, minimize
distractions when they are doing a particular task.

7

People reach flow by working with a specific, clear, and achievable goal in
mind. Whether they are singing, fixing a bike, or running a marathon, the flow
state comes about when people have a specific goal. They then keep that
focused attention and only let in sensory information that fits with the goal.

7

People need to feel that they have a good chance of completing the goal to
get into, and hold onto, the flow state. If they think they have a good chance
of failing at the goal, then the flow state will not be induced. And, conversely,
if the activity is not challenging enough, then they won’t hold their attention
on it and the flow state will end. Make sure to build in enough challenge to
hold attention, but don’t make the tasks so hard that people get discouraged.

7

People need constant feedback. To stay in the flow state, they need a constant stream of information that gives them feedback as to the achievement of
the goal. Make sure you are building in lots of feedback messages as people
perform the tasks.

7

People need to feel they have control over their actions. Control is an important condition of the flow state. They don’t necessarily have to be in control or
feel that they are in control of the entire situation, but they do have to feel that
they’re exercising significant control over their own actions in a challenging
situation. Give people control at various points along the way.

  

38

PEOPLE CAN BE IN A FLOW STATE

93

7

Some people report that time speeds up—they look up and hours have gone
by. Others report that time slows down.

7

To hold on to a flow state people need to feel that the “self” is not threatened.
They have to be relaxed enough to engage all of their attention on the task at
hand. In fact, most people report that they lose their sense of self when they
are absorbed with the task.

7

The flow state is personal. Everyone has different activities that put them in
a flow state. What triggers a flow state for one person might be different from
what triggers it for others.

7

The flow state crosses cultures. So far it seems to be a common human
experience across all cultures, with the exception of people with some mental illnesses. People who have schizophrenia, for example, have a hard time
inducing or staying in a flow state, probably because they have a hard time
with some of the other items mentioned, such as focused attention, control,
or the self not feeling threatened.

7
7

The flow state is pleasurable. People like being in the flow state.
The prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are both involved in getting into and
maintaining a flow state.

Takeaways

Õ If you’re trying to design for, or induce, a flow state (for example, you are a game
designer):

Õ Give people control over their actions during the activity.
Õ Pick the right amount of challenge—too much challenge and people will give up.
Not enough and the flow state won’t start.

Õ Give constant feedback. Feedback is not the same thing as praise (“You’re doing

a great job!”). Feedback is information so the person can tell exactly how they are
doing and what they might need to change in order to reach a goal.

Õ Minimize distractions.

39 CULTURE AFFECTS HOW
PEOPLE THINK

Take a look at Figure 39.1. What do you notice more, the cows or the backgrounds?

FIGURE 39.1 Picture used in Hannah Chua (2005) research

The way you answer might depend on where you grew up—the West (U.S., U.K.,
Europe) or East Asia. In his book The Geography of Thought, Richard Nisbett discusses
research that shows that how we think is influenced and shaped by culture.

EAST = RELATIONSHIPS; WEST = INDIVIDUALISTIC

39

  

If you show people from the West a picture, they focus on a main or dominant foreground object, while people from East Asia pay more attention to context and background. East Asian people who grow up in the West show the Western pattern, not
the Asian pattern, thereby implying that it’s culture, not genetics, that accounts for the
differences.
The theory is that in East Asia, cultural norms emphasize relationships and groups.
East Asians, therefore, grow up learning to pay more attention to context. Western
society is more individualistic, so Westerners grow up learning to pay attention to focal
objects.
Hannah Chua et al. (2005) and Lu Zihui (2008) used the pictures in Figure 39.1
and eye tracking to measure eye movement. They both showed that the East Asian participants spent more time with central vision on the backgrounds and the Western participants spent more time with central vision on the foreground.

CULTURE AFFECTS HOW PEOPLE THINK

95

CULTURAL DIFFERENCES SHOW UP IN BRAIN SCANS
Sharon Begley (2010) wrote an article in Newsweek on neuroscience research that also
confirms the cultural effects:
“When shown complex, busy scenes, Asian-Americans and non-AsianAmericans recruited different brain regions. The Asians showed more
activity in areas that process figure-ground relations—holistic context—
while the Americans showed more activity in regions that recognize
objects.”

N

Concerns about generalizing research?
If Western and Eastern people think differently, then do we have to wonder how much
we can generalize psychology (or other) research results from one group to another?
It’s been common practice to use research subjects from only one geographical region.
Now you have to wonder about the accuracy of some of this research. Does it describe
only the people in that area? Fortunately there is more and more research coming out of
various parts of the world, and more individual studies being conducted in multiple locations. Psychological research now is less focused on one region or group than it was in
the past.

Takeaways

Õ People from different geographical regions and cultures respond differently to photos
and website designs. In East Asia people notice and remember the background and
context more than people in the West do.

Õ If you are designing products for multiple cultures and geographical regions, then you
had better conduct audience research in multiple locations.

Õ When reading psychology research, you might want to avoid generalizing the results if
you know that the study participants were all from one geographical region.

HOW PEOPLE
FOCUS THEIR

ATTENTION
What makes us sit up and take notice? How do you grab and hold
someone’s attention? How do we choose what to notice and what
to pay attention to?

40 ATTENTION IS SELECTIVE
Robert Solso (2005) developed this exercise: in the following paragraph, read only the
words that are bold, and ignore all the other text.
Somewhere Among hidden on a the desert island most near the spectacular X
islands, an cognitive old Survivor abilities contestant is has the concealed ability a box

People are easily distracted in many situations. In fact, their attention can often be
pulled away from what they’re focusing on. But they can also pay attention to one thing
and filter out all other stimuli. This is called selective attention.
How difficult it is to grab their attention depends on how engrossed or involved they
are. For example, if they come to your website to shop for a gift and aren’t sure what
to get, it will be fairly easy to grab their attention with video, a large photo, color, or
animation.
On the other hand, if someone is concentrating on a particular task, such as complet­
ing a complicated form, they’re probably filtering out distractions.
We’ve all had the experience of having a popup window show up on a screen ask­
ing us to subscribe or sign up when we were engrossed in reading an article. The more
engrossed we are, the more annoying that experience is.

UNCONSCIOUS SELECTIVE ATTENTION
Imagine you’re walking down a path in the woods and thinking about an upcoming busi­
ness trip when you see a snake on the ground. You jump backward. Your heart races.
You’re ready to run. But wait—it’s not a snake; it’s just a stick. You calm down and keep
walking. You noticed the stick, and even responded to it, in a largely unconscious way.
Sometimes you’re aware of your conscious selective attention, like when you were
reading the paragraph at the beginning of this chapter. But selective attention also oper­
ates unconsciously.

Your name cuts through your lter and quickly comes to your attention—an example of
your selective attention at work.

Takeaways

Õ People are capable of focusing their attention on one thing and ignoring everything
else when they want to or when they have to in order to complete a difficult task.

Õ Don’t assume, however, that people are always paying close selective attention.
Õ Our unconscious minds constantly scan the environment for certain things. These

40

  

include our own name as well as messages about food, sex, and danger. This means
that people are easily distracted by large images, animation, and video.

PEOPLE HABITUATE TO INFORMATION

In 1988 the U.S. Navy had a ship in the Persian Gulf called the USS Vincennes. One day,
while scanning the radar screen on the ship, the crew saw an aircraft headed their way.
They decided that the approaching aircraft was not a commercial airliner, but a hostile
military plane. They shot down the plane, which did turn out to be a commercial airliner
with 290 passengers and crew onboard. Everyone died.
Many factors led to this erroneous conclusion. The situation was stressful (I’ll cover
stress in the chapter “People Make Mistakes”), and the room was too dark. There were
many ambiguous pieces of information that made it hard for the Vincennes crew to
understand what they were looking at on their radar screen. Most significant, however, is
what they chose to pay attention to and what they chose to ignore.
The crew was used to scanning for hostile military planes. They were “habituated”
to see planes on the radar as military planes, not commercial jets. They had repeatedly
rehearsed the training scenario on what to do when a hostile military plane entered their
air space. They therefore proceeded to carry out the training scenario. All of this led
them to an incorrect conclusion.

Takeaways

Õ Don’t expect that people will necessarily pay attention to information you provide,
especially if they have habituated to certain information and certain actions.

Õ Don’t make assumptions. What is obvious to you as the designer may not be obvious
to the people using what you’ve designed.

Õ If you think people might be habituating and not noticing that information has changed,
then use color, size, animation, video, or sound to draw attention to what’s different.

Õ If it’s critical that people pay attention to certain information, make that information
stand out 10 times more than you think is necessary.

42 WELL PRACTICED SKILLS DON’T

REQUIRE CONSCIOUS ATTENTION

When my children were growing up, they took music lessons using the Suzuki method.
My son studied violin, and my daughter studied piano. After attending one of my daugh­
ter’s recitals, I asked her what she was thinking about while she was performing the
piano sonata from memory, with no music in front of her. The dynamics of the music?
When to get louder or softer? Particular notes or passages that were coming up?
She looked at me in confusion.
“Thinking?” she said. “I’m not thinking about anything. I’m just watching my fingers
play the song.”
It was my turn to be confused.
I turned to my son and asked, “Is that how you play the violin in a recital? Are you
thinking?”
“No, of course I’m not thinking,” he answered. “I’m watching my fingers play the
violin.”
The Suzuki method stresses constant repetition. Students don’t have music in front
of them during recitals; instead, they memorize all the pieces, many of them quite com­
plicated. They practice their music so often that they learn how to play it without even
thinking.
If a skill is practiced so much that it becomes automatic, then it can be performed
with a minimum of conscious attention. If it’s truly automatic, then it almost allows multi­
tasking. I say almost because multitasking doesn’t exist the way most people think
it does.

TOO MANY AUTOMATIC STEPS CAN LEAD TO ERRORS
Have you ever used a software application that requires you to go through a series of
steps to delete an item? You have to click the item, then click the Delete button, and
then a window pops up and you have to click the Yes button to confirm. You need to
delete about 25 files, so you position your fingers in an optimal way and start clicking.
Before too long your fingers have taken over, and you aren’t even thinking about what
you’re doing. In this type of situation it’s easy to accidentally keep deleting past where
you were supposed to stop.

WELL-PRACTICED SKILLS DON’T REQUIRE CONSCIOUS ATTENTION

Takeaways

Õ If people perform a series of steps over and over again, the action will become
automatic.

Õ If you require people to perform a sequence repeatedly, make it easy to do, but realize
-

that the trade off is that people may make errors because they are no longer paying
attention.

Õ Make it easy for people to undo not only their last action but also an entire sequence.
Õ Rather than requiring people to perform a task over and over, consider a design where
they can choose all the items they want to take action on and then perform the action
on all the items at once.

AFFECT ATTENTION

Farid Seif, a businessman from Houston, Texas, boarded a flight in Houston with a
loaded handgun in his laptop case. He made it through security without a problem. Seif
was not a terrorist. The gun was legal in Texas; he simply forgot to take it out of his lap­
top case before his trip.
Security at the Houston airport did not detect the gun. It should have been easily
seen by security personnel looking at the X ray scanner, but no one noticed it.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security routinely tests the ability to pass security
screening with guns, bomb parts, and other forbidden items by sending them through
with undercover agents. The U.S. government won’t release the figures officially, but the
estimate is that 70 percent of these tests fail, meaning most of the time the agents are
able to get through security, like Farid Seif, with objects that are supposed to be spotted.
Why does this happen? Why do security personnel notice the bottle of lotion that is
too large but miss a loaded handgun?

A MENTAL MODEL ABOUT FREQUENCY

43

  

Security personnel miss the loaded handgun and bomb parts at least in part because
they don’t encounter them frequently. A security officer is working for hours at a time,
watching people and looking at the scanner screen. They develop an expectation
about how frequently certain violations occur. For example, they probably encounter
containers of hand lotion or pocketknives fairly often, so they expect to see those and
then look for them. On the other hand, they probably don’t encounter loaded handguns
or bomb parts very often. They create a mental model about how frequently any of
these items will appear and then, unconsciously, start paying attention accordingly.
Andrew Bellenkes (1997) conducted research on this expectation and found that if
people expect something to happen with a particular frequency, they often miss it if it
happens more or less than their expectations. They have a mental model of how often
something will occur, and they have set their attention to that mental model.

EXPECTATIONS OF FREQUENCY AFFECT ATTENTION

Signal if it’s infrequent and important
I use my laptop for hours every day, and most of the time it’s plugged in. But sometimes
I forget to plug it in and my battery gets low. There is an indicator on my screen that
constantly shows that the battery power is disappearing, but if I’m at home, I think I’m
plugged in and I don’t notice the indicator.

Takeaways

fi

fi

Eventually (about 8 percent of battery left), my computer makes a sound, and a message
pops up to alert me that the battery is very low. This is an example of signaling when an
event is infrequent but important. (I wish that the machine gave me the option of customizing when I want to be alerted, however. By the time I get the alert, the battery is really
low. Then I run around panicked trying to nd my plug or an outlet or saving les.)

Õ People will build an unconscious mental model of how often an event occurs.
Õ If you’re designing a product or application where people need to notice an event that
rarely occurs, use a strong signal to get their attention when it does.

Imagine you’re in a meeting and someone is presenting sales figures for the last quar­
ter. How long can they hold your attention? If the topic is of interest to you and they’re a
good presenter, you can focus on the presentation for 7 to 10 minutes at most. If you’re
not interested in the topic or the presenter is particularly boring, then you’ll lose interest
much faster. Figure 44.1 shows what the graph looks like.

People can take a short break and then start over with another 7 to 10 minute
period, but 7 to 10 minutes is about as long as we can pay attention to any one task.
If you’re designing a website, you’re probably designing pages that someone views
for a lot less than 7 minutes. You’re assuming that someone comes to the page, looks for
a link, and clicks it. But sometimes you might add other media, such as audio or video.
These media are subject to the 7 to 10 minute rule. TED videos are typically 20 minutes
long, so they’re going over the limit (although they have some of the world’s greatest
speakers and so might be able to stretch it).

Takeaways

Õ Assume that you have at most 7 to 10 minutes of a person’s attention.
Õ If you must hold attention longer than 7 to 10 minutes, introduce novel information or a
break.

Õ Keep online demos or tutorials under 7 to 10 minutes in length.

45 PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION ONLY TO
SALIENT CUES

Look at the pictures of a U.S. penny
in Figure 45.1. Which one is the real
penny? Don’t cheat. Try to figure it out
first, before you go get a penny to check.
If you live in the U.S. and use U.S.
coins, then a penny is something you’ve
probably seen a lot. But you only pay
attention to certain attributes of the
penny—for instance, its color and size.
These are what psychologists call “salient
cues.” You only pay attention to what
FIGURE 45.1 Which is the real penny?
you need for the task at hand. Although
there’s a lot of detail on the penny, a lot of
cues, the salient ones for most people are color and size. If you’re a coin collector, then
the salient cues are different. Salient cues for a coin collector might include the date,
wording, or particular pictures.
As we saw in the chapter “How People See,” you can look at something and not
really see it. Similarly, every day you experience a lot of things through sight, sound,
taste, and touch that you don’t pay attention to. People are unconsciously aware that
they have limited resources, and the brain therefore decides what it really needs to pay
attention to and what it can ignore.
Did you guess the right penny? (It’s A.)

Takeaways

Õ Decide what the salient cues are for your audience.
Õ Design so that the salient cues are obvious.
Õ Realize that people will probably pay attention only to salient cues.

HOW PEOPLE FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION

46 PEOPLE ARE WORSE AT

MULTITASKING THAN THEY THINK

Many people think they are great at multitasking and even pride themselves on their
multitasking abilities. But the research on multitasking shows that most people are
worse at it than they think.
Most of the time what people are doing when they think they are multitasking is “task
switching.” People can attend to only one task at a time. You can only think about one
thing at a time. You can only conduct one mental activity at a time. So you can talk, or
you can read. You can read, or you can type. You can listen, or you can read—one thing
at a time. We are pretty good at switching back and forth quickly, so we think we are mul­
titasking, but in reality most of the time we are not.

ONE EXCEPTION
Research has uncovered one exception: if you are doing a physical task that you have
done very, very often and you are very good at, then you can do that physical task
while you are doing a mental task. So if you are an adult and you have learned to walk,
then you can walk and talk at the same time. Well, maybe. Even walking and talking
doesn’t always work very well. A study by Ira Hyman (2009) showed that people talk­
ing on their cellphones while walking ran into people (literally) more often and didn’t
notice what was around them. The researchers had someone in a clown suit ride a uni­
cycle. The people talking on a cellphone were much less likely to notice or remember
the clown.

Driving while on a cellphone is an attention problem

fl

In many parts of the U.S., it is now illegal to drive while holding a cellphone, but it is okay
to use a cellphone while driving if you have a hands-free phone. There’s a aw in this
thinking. It’s not the holding of the phone that is a problem—it’s the conversation you
are having with the other person. When you have a phone conversation, your attention
is on the conversation, and therefore your attention is not on driving. It’s an attention
problem, not just a hands-free problem.

PEOPLE ARE WORSE AT MULTITASKING THAN THEY THINK

107

Overhearing someone talk on a cellphone is more annoying than
overhearing two people in conversation
A one-sided conversation (or halfalogue) uses more of your mental resources because
the information is less predictable. You’re in suspense wondering what you’re missing
in the other half of the conversation. Lauren Emberson (2010) tested participants on different mental tasks. They performed much better on tasks when they heard both sides
of a cellphone call than when they heard a halfalogue. The researchers controlled for
acoustic factors (quality of the sound, and so on), so they concluded that this difference
occurs because the halfalogue is unpredictable. Because participants are thinking about
the half of the conversation they’re missing, they are not paying attention to the task at
hand.

DO AGE AND MULTITASKING EXPERIENCE MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
Eyal Ophir and Clifford Nass (2009) conducted a series of studies on college students
and determined that they were no better at multitasking than the general population.
They developed a questionnaire, which asked people how many different media they
use simultaneously. They then picked people who were at either end of the spectrum:
heavy media multitaskers (HMMs) and light media multitaskers (LMMs).
Next, they had people from each group perform several tasks. For example, they
showed people two red rectangles alone or two red rectangles surrounded by four or six
blue rectangles. These objects were flashed twice, and the participants had to decide
whether the two red rectangles had moved from the first flash to the second. They were
supposed to ignore the blue rectangles.
What they found was opposite to what they thought they would find. The LMMs were
able to ignore the blue rectangles, but the HMMs had a harder time ignoring the blue
rectangles and therefore did much worse on the task. Next they tried tasks that involved
letters and numbers. The results were always the same: the HMMs were actually more
distracted by irrelevant stimuli than the LMMs, and performed poorly on the tasks.

SOME PEOPLE ENJOY MULTITASKING
Although most people are worse at multitasking than they think, some people enjoy
the experience. They like to watch sports on the TV while also texting with friends. But
don’t confuse liking the experience of multitasking with being good at it.

Takeaways

Õ People think they are better at multitasking than they are.
Õ Some people like multitasking and may confuse liking it with being better at it.
Õ Young people do not multitask better than older people.
Õ Avoid forcing people to multitask. It is difficult for them to do two things at once (for

example, have a conversation with a customer while filling out a form on a computer
or tablet device). If people must multitask, pay particular attention to the ease of use of
whatever tool they are using.

Õ If you require people to multitask, expect them to make more errors. Build in ways for

them to fix errors afterward.

WHY PEOPLE CAN’T RESIST PAYING ATTENTION TO FOOD, SEX,
AND DANGER
Have you ever wondered why traffic always slows when people are driving by an accident?
Do you moan about the fact that people are attracted by the gruesome and yet find that you
glance over too as you drive by? Well, it’s not really your fault that you (and everybody else)
can’t resist looking at scenes of danger. It’s your old brain telling you to PAY ATTENTION.

You have three brains
In my book Neuro Web Design: What Makes Them Click? I talk about the idea that you
really don’t have one brain, you have three. The new brain is the conscious, reasoning,
logical brain that you think you know best, the mid-brain is the part that processes emo­
tions, and the old brain is the part that is most interested in your survival. From an evo­
lutionary perspective, the old brain developed first. In fact, that part of our brain is very
similar to that of a reptile, which is why some people call it the “reptilian brain.”

Can I eat it? Can I have sex with it? Will it kill me?
The job of your old brain is to constantly scan the environment and answer the ques­
tions “Can I eat it? Can I have sex with it? Will it kill me?” That’s really all the old brain
cares about (Figure 47.1). When you think about it, this is important. Without food you’ll
die, without sex the species won’t survive, and if you’re killed, the other two questions
don’t matter. So animal brains developed early on to care intensely about these three
topics. As animals evolved they developed other capacities (emotions, logical thought),
but a part of their brain was retained that always scans for these three critical things.

110

FIGURE 47.1 Looking at food is one of the things your old brain can’t resist
(Photo by Guthrie Weinschenk)

So you can’t resist
What this means is that you just can’t resist noticing food, sex, or danger, no matter how
hard you try not to. It’s the old brain working. You don’t necessarily have to do anything
once you notice; for example, you don’t have to eat the chocolate cake when you see
it, you don’t have to flirt with the attractive person who walked into the room, and you
don’t have to run away from the big, scary guy who walked in the room with the good­
looking woman. But you will notice all of those things whether you want to or not.

8

Your attention is riveted by pictures of people
People are hard wired to pay attention to faces. Read the chapter “How People See” for
more details on the parts of the brain that process faces.

Takeaways

Õ It may not always be appropriate to use food, sex, or danger in your web page or soft­
ware application, but if you do, they’ll get a lot of attention.
-

Õ Use up close images of faces.
Õ Use stories as much as you can, even for what you think is factual information.

PEOPLE HABITUATE TO AUDITORY STIMULI
Have you visited with someone who had a clock that chimed every hour? You’re lying
in bed about to doze off, and there goes that darn clock again. “How can anyone get
any sleep in this house?” you wonder. Yet everyone who lives in the house sleeps just
fine. They have habituated to the sound of the clock chimes. Because they hear it every
hour, they don’t pay attention to it anymore.
Your unconscious mind is constantly surveying your environment making sure that
nothing in it is dangerous. That’s why anything new or novel in the environment will get
your attention. But if the same signal occurs again and again, eventually your uncon­
scious mind decides it is not new anymore and therefore starts to ignore it.

49 FOR PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION

TO SOMETHING, THEY MUST FIRST
PERCEIVE IT

For you to pay attention to something, you must be able to sense and perceive it. Here
are some examples of the sensitivity of your senses:
Sight: If you’re standing at a high point in total darkness, you can see a candle
30 miles away.
Sound: If you’re in a very quiet room, you can hear a watch ticking 20 feet away.
Smell: You can smell a drop of perfume in about 800 square feet of space.
Touch: You can feel a human hair on your skin.
Taste: You can taste a teaspoon of sugar in two gallons of water.

SIGNAL DETECTION THEORY
If you can’t find your watch and you’re trying to figure out where you left it, then you’ll
hear it ticking if you’re within 20 feet of it. But what if you aren’t looking for your watch?
What if you’re unconcerned with your watch, and instead you’re thinking about what to
have for dinner. In that case you may not even realize that there’s a watch ticking at all.
Detecting something is not necessarily simple. Your senses may perceive a stimulus,
but that doesn’t mean that you’re paying attention to it.

Sensitivity and bias
Imagine you’re expecting someone to come by and pick you up. They’re late, and
you keep running to the door thinking you heard the car in the driveway, even
though you didn’t.
Whether you perceive something or not depends on more than just the stimulus
being there. In fact, sometimes the stimulus is there and you miss it, and sometimes it’s
not there and you think you hear or see it.
Scientists call this signal detection theory. There are four possible outcomes, as
shown in Figure 49.1.
This is not just a conceptual idea. There are real cases that signal detection research­
ers study. Take, for example, a radiologist who looks at dozens of medical images every
day. The radiologist has to decide if there is a small dot on the image and if it’s cancer or

114

HOW PEOPLE FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION

not. If they see a cancer dot when none is there (false alarm), then the patient may have
surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy when it’s unnecessary. On the other hand,
if they miss a cancer dot that was actually there, then the patient may die because treat­
ment was not given early enough. Psychologists study the different conditions that make
it more likely for people to detect a signal accurately.

HOW TO APPLY SIGNAL DETECTION THEORY

-

Let’s say you’re designing a new system for air traffic controllers to see how many
planes are near each other in the air space. You don’t want misses, so you turn up the
signal (use brighter lights, more sound) to make sure the controller doesn’t miss the sig­
nal. If you were designing the screen to show X ray results for the radiologist, you would
turn down the signal a little bit to avoid false alarms.

Takeaways

Õ If you’re designing for a particular task, think about the four quadrants of the signal
detection chart. Is it more damaging for people to have a false alarm or a miss?

Õ Think about what you may need to do with your design based on the four quadrants of

49

  

the signal detection chart. If a false alarm is worse, then tone down the signal. If a miss
is worse, then make the signal stronger.

WHAT


MOTIVATES

PEOPLE

New research on motivation reveals that some of the supposedly
tried-and-true methods for getting and keeping people motivated
may have been tried, but they’re not quite true.

50 PEOPLE ARE MORE MOTIVATED AS
THEY GET CLOSER TO A GOAL

You’re given a frequent-buyer card for your local coffee shop. Each time you buy a cup
of coffee you get a stamp on your card. When the card is filled, you get a free cup of
coffee. Here are two different scenarios:

7

Card A: The card has 10 boxes for the stamps, and when you get the card, all
the boxes are blank.

7

Card B: The card has 12 boxes for the stamps, and when you get the card the
first two boxes are already stamped.

Question: How long will it take you to get the card filled up? Will it take more or less
time for scenario A versus scenario B? After all, you have to buy 10 cups of coffee in
both scenarios in order to get the free coffee. So does it make a difference which card
you use?
The answer, apparently, is yes. You’ll fill up the card faster with Card B than with
Card A. And the reason is called the goal-gradient effect.
The goal-gradient effect was first studied in 1934 by Clark Hull using rats. He found
that rats that were running a maze to get food at the end would run faster as they got to
the end of the maze. The goal-gradient effect says that you will accelerate your behavior
as you progress closer to your goal. The coffee reward card scenarios I describe above
were part of a research study by Ran Kivetz (2006) to see if people would act like the
rats did in the original 1934 study. And the answer is yes, they do.
Kivetz also found that people enjoyed being part of the rewards program. Compared
to customers who were not part of the program, customers with reward cards smiled
more, chatted longer with café employees, and left a tip more often.
In addition to the coffee shop study, Kivetz found that people would go to a website
more frequently and rate more songs during each visit as they got closer to a reward
goal at the site.

118

WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE

8

People focus on what’s left more than on what’s completed
Minjung Koo and Ayelet Fishbach (2010) conducted research to see which would motivate people more to reach a goal: A) focusing on what they’d already completed, or B)
focusing on what remained to accomplish. The answer was B—people were more motivated to continue when they focused on what was left to do.

8

Motivation plummets right after a reward is reached
After customers reach the reward goal motivation, purchasing tends to plummet. This is
referred to as a post-reward resetting phenomenon. You are most at risk of losing a customer right after a reward is reached.

Takeaways

Õ The shorter the distance to the goal, the more motivated people are to reach it. People
are even more motivated when the end is in sight.

Õ You can get this extra motivation even with the illusion of progress, as in the coffee

card B example in this section. There really isn’t any progress (you still have to buy 10
coffees), but it seems like there has been some progress, so it has the same effect.

Õ People enjoy being part of a reward program. But watch out. Activity plummets right

50

  

after the goal is reached, and you are most at risk of losing a customer right after a
reward is reached. You may want to have extra interactions after giving a reward (for
example, you may want to send an email thanking them for being a loyal customer).

PEOPLE ARE MORE MOTIVATED AS THEY GET CLOSER TO A GOAL

119

51 VARIABLE REWARDS ARE POWERFUL
If you studied psychology in the twentieth century, you may remember B. F. Skinner
and his work on operant conditioning. Skinner studied whether behavior increased
or decreased based on how often, and in what manner, a reinforcement (reward) was
given.

WHAT THE CASINOS KNOW
Let’s say you put a rat in a cage with a bar. If the rat presses the bar, he gets a food pellet. The food pellet is called the reinforcement. But what if you set it up so that the rat
does not get the food pellet every time he presses the bar? Skinner tested various scenarios and found that the frequency with which you gave the food pellet, and whether
you gave it based on elapsed time or bar presses, affected how often the rat would
press the bar. Here’s a synopsis of the different schedules:

7

Interval schedules. You provide a food pellet after a certain interval of time
has passed—for example, five minutes. The rat gets a food pellet the first time
he presses the bar after five minutes is up.

Ratio schedules. Instead of basing the reinforcement on time, you base it
on the number of bar presses. The rat gets a food pellet after every 10 bar
presses.
There’s another twist. You can have fixed or variable variations on each schedule. If
it’s a fixed schedule, then you keep the same interval or ratio—for example, every five
minutes or every 10 presses. If it’s variable, then you vary the time or ratio, but it averages out; for example, sometimes you provide the reinforcement after two minutes,
sometimes after eight minutes, but it averages out to five minutes.
So altogether there are four possible schedules:

FIGURE 51.1 Reinforcement schedules for operant conditioning

N

Operant conditioning fell out of favor
In the 1960s and 1970s operant conditioning was the theory at many university psychology departments around the world. But many psychologists from other points of view
(for example, cognitive or social psychology) were not fans, and it fell out of favor after
that. Other learning and motivation theories became more popular, and these days
operant conditioning gets maybe one lecture and a few pages in the textbook during a
college Introductory Psychology class. If you haven’t guessed, I was trained in operant
conditioning during my undergraduate work, and I’m a fan. Although I do not believe that
operant conditioning explains all behavior and motivation, I do believe that the theories
are well tested, and they work. I’ve personally used them in my management style, in my
classroom style when I’m teaching, and in my child-rearing practices.

You can predict, then, how often people will engage in a certain behavior based on
the way they are reinforced or rewarded. If you want someone to engage in a certain
behavior the most, then you would use a variable ratio schedule.
If you’ve ever been to Las Vegas, then chances are you’ve seen a variable ratio
schedule in operation. You put your token in the slot machine and press the button. You

don’t know how often you’ll win. It’s based not on time, but rather on the number of times
you play. And it’s not a fixed schedule, but a variable one. It’s not predictable. You’re
not sure when you’re going to win, but you know that your odds of winning increase the
more times you play. So it will result in you playing the most (and the casino making the
most money).

OPERANT THEORY AND DESIGN
If you’re not sure that operant conditioning is related to design, think about it more
deeply. Many times as designers you want to encourage people to engage in a certain
behavior over and over. Take the study by Kivetz in the beginning of this chapter. The
rewards card is actually an example of a fixed-ratio schedule: you buy 10 cups of coffee
(press the bar 10 times), and then you get a free coffee.
Another example is Dropbox.com. For every friend you get to join Dropbox you
receive extra storage space.
There is one more type of reinforcement schedule: continuous. If you get a reward
every time you engage in a behavior, then you are on a continuous reinforcement schedule. Continuous reinforcement schedules are good to use when you are trying to establish a new behavior. But Skinner showed that once the behavior is established you will
actually get more of the behavior if you do not give a reward every time. Dropbox might
get more people recommending it to friends if it gave a larger reward for every three or
five friends—in other words, if it switched to a fixed-ratio schedule rather than a continuous schedule.

Takeaways

Õ For operant conditioning to work, the reinforcement (reward) must be something that
particular audience wants. Hungry rats want food pellets. What does your particular
audience really want?

Õ Think about the pattern of behavior you’re looking for, and then adjust the schedule of
rewards to fit that schedule. Use a variable-ratio schedule for the maximum behavior
repetition.

Õ Use a continuous reward to set a new behavior, but then switch to a different schedule
to keep people taking the action.

WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE

52 DOPAMINE STIMULATES THE SEEKING
OF INFORMATION

Do you ever feel like you’re addicted to email or Twitter or texting? Do you find it impossible to ignore your email if you see a notification icon indicating that there are messages
in your inbox? Have you ever searched online for something and realized 30 minutes later
that you’ve been reading and linking and searching around for something totally different
than your original search? These are all examples of your dopamine system at work.
Neuroscientists have been studying what they call the dopamine system since 1958,
when it was identified by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Ake Hillarp at the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Dopamine is created in various parts of the brain and is critical in all
sorts of brain functions, including thinking, moving, sleeping, mood, attention, motivation,
seeking, and reward.

PLEASURE CHEMICAL OR MOTIVATION CHEMICAL?
You may have heard that dopamine controls the “pleasure” systems of the brain that
make you feel enjoyment. But researchers have found that instead of causing you to
experience pleasure, dopamine actually causes you to want, desire, seek out, and
search. It increases your general level of arousal, motivation, and goal-directed behavior. It’s not only about physical needs such as food or sex, but also about abstract concepts. Dopamine makes you curious about ideas and fuels your search for information.
The latest research shows that it is the opioid system, more than the dopamine system,
that is involved in feelings of pleasure.
According to Kent Berridge (1998), these two systems—the “wanting” (dopamine) and
the “liking” (opioid)—are complementary. The wanting system propels you to action, and
the liking system makes you feel satisfied and therefore makes you pause your seeking.
If your seeking isn’t turned off, then you start to run in an endless loop. The dopamine
system is stronger than the opioid system. You seek more than you are satisfied.

Dopamine evolved to keep us alive
Dopamine is critical from an evolutionary standpoint. If humans had not been driven by
curiosity to seek out things and ideas, then they would have just sat in their caves. The
dopamine seeking system kept our ancestors motivated to move through the world,
learn, and survive. Seeking was more likely to keep them alive than was sitting around in
a satis ed stupor.

Anticipation is better than getting
Brain scan research shows that our brains show more stimulation and activity when we
anticipate a reward than when we get one. Research on rats shows that if you destroy
dopamine neurons, rats can walk, chew, and swallow, but they will starve to death even
when food is right next to them. They have lost the desire to go get the food.

Takeaways

Õ People are motivated to keep seeking information.
Õ The easier you make it for people to find information, the more information-seeking
behavior they will engage in.

124

WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE

53 UNPREDICTABILITY KEEPS PEOPLE
SEARCHING

Dopamine is also stimulated by unpredictability. When something happens that is not
exactly predictable, it stimulates the dopamine system. Think about electronic devices.
Emails and tweets and texts show up, but you don’t know exactly when they will arrive
or who they will be from. It’s unpredictable. This is exactly what stimulates the dopamine
system. It’s the same system at work for gambling and slot machines. Basically, email,
Twitter, and most social media run on the variable-ratio schedule discussed earlier in this
chapter. That makes it likely that people will engage in the behavior again and again.

THE PAVLOVIAN REFLEX
The dopamine system is especially sensitive to cues that a reward is coming. If there is
a small, specific cue that signifies that something is going to happen, that sets off your
dopamine system. This is a Pavlovian response, named for the Russian scientist Ivan
Pavlov, who experimented with dogs. When dogs (and humans) see food, they begin
to salivate. Pavlov paired food with a sound—for instance, a bell. The bell is a stimulus.
Every time the dogs saw food they would also hear a bell, and they would salivate at
the sight of the food. After a while the dogs would salivate at the sound of the bell.
The food wasn’t even necessary for salivation to occur. When a stimulus is paired with
information-seeking behavior, such as a sound and a message when a text or email
arrives on your phone (Figure 53.1), you have the same Pavlovian response—dopamine
is released and the information seeking starts all over again.

FIGURE 53.1 Getting a notification that you have a message is a Pavlovian cue

  

53

UNPREDICTABILITY KEEPS PEOPLE SEARCHING

125

SMALL AMOUNTS ARE EVEN MORE ADDICTIVE
The dopamine system is most powerfully stimulated when the information comes in
small amounts so that it doesn’t fully satisfy the desire for information. A short text is
ideally suited to sending the dopamine system raging.

THE DOPAMINE LOOP
Our technology tools and notifications provide almost instant gratification of our desire
to seek. Want to talk to someone right away? Send a text and they respond in a few
seconds. Want to look up some information? Just search online. Want to see what your
friends are up to? Go to your favorite social media app. You can get into a dopamineinduced loop: dopamine starts you seeking, you get rewarded for seeking, and that
makes you seek more. It becomes harder and harder to stop looking and checking to
see if you have a new message.

N

How to break dopamine loops

fi

In contrast to wanting to set up dopamine loops, you might be tired of being in one yourself. The constant stimulation of the dopamine system can be exhausting. To break a
dopamine loop you need to get away from the information-seeking environment—that is,
turn off your devices, leave them out of sight and reach, or both. One of the most powerful things you can do to end a dopamine loop is to turn off the noti cations that tell you
that a message has arrived.

Takeaways

Õ Pairing cues such as sounds with the arrival of information motivates people to seek
more.

Õ Giving small bits of information and then providing a way for people to get more information results in more information-seeking behavior.

Õ The more unpredictable the arrival of information is, the more people will be addicted
to seeking it.

WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE

54 PEOPLE ARE MORE MOTIVATED

BY INTRINSIC REWARDS THAN BY
EXTRINSIC REWARDS

Let’s say you’re an art teacher, and you want to encourage your class to spend more
time drawing. You create a Good Drawing Certificate to give to your students. If your
goal is to have them draw more and to stick with it, how should you give them the certificate? Should you give them one every time they draw? Or only sometimes?
Mark Lepper, David Greene, and Richard Nisbett (1973) conducted research on this
question. They divided children into three groups:

7

Group 1 was the Expected group. The researchers showed the children the
Good Drawing Certificate and asked if they wanted to draw in order to get
the certificate.

7

Group 2 was the Unexpected group. The researchers asked the children if
they wanted to draw but didn’t mention anything about a certificate. After the
children spent time drawing, they received an unexpected drawing certificate.

7

Group 3 was the control group. The researchers asked the children if they
wanted to draw but didn’t mention a certificate and didn’t give them one.

The real part of the experiment came two weeks later. During playtime the drawing tools were put out in the room. The children weren’t asked anything about drawing; the tools were just put in the room and available. What happened? Children in the
Unexpected group and the control group spent the most time drawing. The children in
the Expected group, the ones who had received an expected reward, spent the least
time drawing. Contingent rewards (rewards given based on specific behavior that is
spelled out ahead of time) resulted in less of the desired behavior if the reward was not
repeated. The researchers went on to do more studies like this, with adults as well as
children, and found similar results.

People are motivated unconsciously
You have the experience of deciding to achieve a particular goal, and so you think that
shows that motivation is a conscious process. But research by Ruud Custers and Henk
Aarts (2010) shows that at least some goals occur unconsciously. Your unconscious sets
the goal and then eventually the goal surfaces to conscious thought.

Promising monetary rewards releases dopamine

fi

Brian Knutson (2001) found that when people are promised a monetary reward for work,
there is increased activity in the nucleus accumbens—the same area that is active when
people anticipate cocaine, tobacco, or any addictive substance. Dopamine is released,
and there is an increase in risky behavior. Giving people money back res, since they’ll
come to rely on the monetary reward and then be unwilling to work unless there is a
monetary incentive.

FROM ALGORITHMIC WORK TO HEURISTIC WORK
In Drive (2009), Daniel Pink writes that until recently most work involved algorithmic
work—follow a procedure to accomplish a task. But now 70 percent of people (in developing countries) do heuristic work—there are no set procedures. Traditional punishments and rewards are based on extrinsic motivation and work well for algorithmic
work, not for heuristic work. Heuristic work assumes the work itself provides intrinsic
motivation through a sense of accomplishment.

8

People are motivated by the possibility of being connected
In the “People Are Social Animals” chapter, I cover how social people are and how being
social affects expectations and behaviors. The opportunity to be social is also a strong
motivating factor. People will be motivated to use a product just because it allows them
to connect with others.

Takeaways

Õ Don’t assume that money or any other extrinsic reward is the best way to reward people. Look for intrinsic rewards rather than extrinsic rewards.

Õ If you’re going to give an extrinsic reward, it will be more motivating if it is unexpected.
Õ If the product you’re designing allows people to connect with other people, then they
will be motivated to use it.

PROGRESS, MASTERY, AND CONTROL

Why do people donate their time and creative thought process to Wikipedia? Or the
open source movement? When you stop and think about it, you realize that there are
many activities that people engage in, even over a long period of time, that require high
expertise and yet offer no monetary or even career-building benefit. People like to feel
that they are making progress. They like to feel that they are learning and mastering
new knowledge and skills.

SMALL SIGNS OF PROGRESS CAN HAVE A BIG EFFECT
Because mastery is such a powerful motivator, even small signs of progress can have a
large effect in motivating people to move forward to the next step in a task. For example,
Figure 55.1 shows how much progress I’ve made in completing an online course.

In Drive, Daniel Pink says that mastery can be approached but never really reached.
Figure 55.2 shows what this constant getting closer but never reaching looks like on
a graph. The graph is known as an asymptote. You can get better and better, but you
don’t really reach an endpoint. This is one of the factors that makes mastery such a
compelling motivator.

FIGURE 55.2 According to Daniel Pink, mastery is an asymptote—it can never

Takeaways

Õ If you want to build loyalty and have repeat customers (for example, repeat visitors to

your website), you’ll need to have activities that people inherently want to do (such as
connecting with their friends or mastering something new), rather than just activities for
which people are getting paid.

Õ If people have to do a task that’s boring, you can help motivate them by acknowledging that it’s boring and then letting them do it their own way.

Õ Look for ways to help people set goals and track them.
Õ Show people how they’re progressing toward goals.

WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE

56 PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED BY
SOCIAL NORMS

Jessica Nolan (2008) wanted to know if it is possible to change behavior just by giving
people information, and if it is, what type of information is most likely to result in behavior change.
Nolan created five messages about using less electricity:
1.

Using less electricity protects the environment.

2. Using less electricity makes you more socially responsible.
3. Using less electricity saves you money.
4. Your neighbors used less electricity.
5. Here’s the amount of electricity you used.
The only group that ended up using less electricity was the one that heard message 4.
When people were given information (by the way, this was actual data) that showed how
their own electrical usage compared to the other homes in their neighborhood, then they
changed their behavior.
People are very influenced by the behavior of others. Most people tend to follow the
norms or behavior of those around them, and if they are given information about their
own behavior and the normative behavior, most people will change their behavior to better match what others are doing.

Takeaways

Õ People are very sensitive to how their behavior aligns with the behavior of others.
Õ If you want to change behavior, a good method is to let people know what others

are doing. They will likely start to change their own behavior to line up with the social
norms.

Õ To make use of social norms, provide information in your content about what others

are doing, and, if possible, directly show how others’ data or information is similar to or
different from your users’ own.

57 PEOPLE ARE INHERENTLY LAZY
It might be exaggerating a bit to say that people are inherently lazy. But research does
show us that people will do the least amount of work possible to get a task done.

IS LAZY ANOTHER WORD FOR EFFICIENT?
Over eons of evolution, humans have learned that they will survive longer and better if they conserve their energy. You want to spend enough energy to have sufficient
resources (food, water, sex, shelter), but beyond that you are wasting your energy if you
spend too much time running around getting or doing more stuff. Of course, questions
about how much is enough, whether we have enough stuff yet, and how long should
the stuff will last (and on and on) still vex us, but putting the philosophical questions
aside, for most activities most of the time, humans work on a principle called satisficing.

SATISFY PLUS SUFFICE EQUALS SATISFICE
­

Herbert Simon is credited with coining the term satisfice. He used it to describe a
decision-making strategy in which the person decides to pick the option that is adequate rather than optimal. The idea of satisficing is that the cost of making a complete
analysis of all the options is not only not worth it but might be impossible. According
to Simon we often don’t have the cognitive faculties to weigh all the options. It makes
more sense to make a decision based on “what will do” or what is “good enough” rather
than trying to find the optimal or perfect solution. If people satisfice rather than optimize,
there are implications for the design of websites, software, and other products.

DESIGN WEBSITES FOR SCANNING, NOT READING
In his book Don’t Make Me Think (2005), Steve Krug applies the idea of satisficing to the
behavior you can observe when someone comes to your website. You’re hoping the
visitor will read the whole page, but, as Krug says, “What they actually do most of the
time (if we’re lucky) is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click the first
link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. There
are usually large parts of the page that they don’t even look at.” Krug talks about web
pages being like billboards. You have to assume that people are taking a quick glance.
Keeping this idea in mind, look quickly at Figures 57.1 and 57.2, from two government websites in the U.S.

PEOPLE ARE INHERENTLY LAZY

133

With this quick look you might get the feeling that the Appalachian website will
require more work to use than the Medicare website. You make a decision that a particular website will be easy to use based on the impression the site provides in one or two
seconds of viewing. The Medicare website has a larger font, better division of space, and
less on the page compared with the Appalachian website.
The first impressions about satisficing can be critically important in determining
whether someone stays at the website or not.

Takeaways

Õ Assume that people will get things done with the least amount of work possible. That
may not always be the case, but it’s true more often than not.

Õ People will satisfice—that is, look for the good-enough solution rather than the optimal
solution.

Õ The first glance at a page influences the impression about whether it will be easy to

use. Large fonts and enough white space at first glance makes a website seem easier
to use.

134

WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE

58 PEOPLE WILL LOOK FOR SHORTCUTS
ONLY IF THE SHORTCUTS ARE EASY

Do you use keyboard shortcuts when you’re typing? Do you use some, but not others?
Why do you do that?
People will look for ways to do something faster and with fewer steps. This is especially
true if it’s a task they’re doing over and over. But if the shortcut is too hard to find or if a
habit is ingrained, then people will keep doing it the old way. This seems paradoxical, but
it’s all about the perceived amount of work. If it seems like too much work to find a shortcut,
then people will stay with their old habits (they are even satisficing about satisficing).

PROVIDE DEFAULTS
Defaults reduce the amount of work needed to complete a task. When you provide
defaults—for example, filling in the person’s name and address automatically on a
form—then there is less work to finish the form. But there are some potential problems with defaults. One is that people don’t always notice defaults and so may end
up accepting a default without meaning to. Here again, the answer lies in the amount
of effort. If it takes a lot of work to change the result of accepting “wrong” defaults,
then think twice about using them in your design.

When defaults create more work, not less
Recently I bought a pair of shoes for my daughter. The next time I went to the website,
it was to buy a pair of shoes for myself. But the default shipping address was the last
address used—my daughter’s, not mine. I didn’t notice that the shipping address had
filled in with a default that was not my home address. My daughter was surprised to get
a pair of shoes she hadn’t asked for. In this case, having a default in place meant a lot
more work for both my daughter and me.

Takeaways

Õ Provide shortcuts as long as they are easy to learn, find, and use, but don’t assume
that people will always use them.

Õ Provide defaults if you know what most people will want to do most of the time and if

the result of choosing a default by mistake does not cause costly errors.

59 PEOPLE ASSUME IT’S YOU,
NOT THE SITUATION

A man is walking down a busy city street on his way to an appointment, and he sees
what looks like a college student drop a folder of papers. The papers scatter on the
ground, and the man glances over but keeps on walking. What do you think? Why didn’t
the man stop to help with the papers?
If you answer, “Well, he’s a self-absorbed person who doesn’t usually help out strangers on the street,” then chances are likely that you have just made a fundamental attribution error. People have a tendency to give personality-based explanations for other
people’s behavior more weight than situational factors. Alternatively, instead of explaining the person’s behavior in the story as being due to his “self-absorption,” you might
ascribe his behavior to the situation—for example, “He’s late for a critical meeting with
the bank and doesn’t have time to stop today. In other circumstances he would have
stopped.” But in reality you don’t apply that situational motivation to him. You assume it’s
not the situation but his personality that is causing his behavior.

BUT FOR YOU, IT’S SITUATIONAL
On the other hand, if you’re analyzing and explaining your own behavior and motivations, then you will tend to think the opposite of what you attribute to others. In other
words, you assume that your motivation and behavior are based on a reaction to the
situation, not to personality factors. If you didn’t stop and help the person pick up the
papers, you would say it was because you were late for your meeting and didn’t have
time to stop, or some other situation-based explanation.
Research on the fundamental attribution error shows the following:

7

In cultures that value individualistic behavior (like the U.S.), it’s common to
ascribe other people’s behavior to personality. The fundamental attribution
error is common in these cultures.

7

On the other hand, in individualistic cultures people tend to ascribe their own
behavior to situational factors more than to personality factors.

7

In cultures that value collectivist behavior (China, for example), people make
the same fundamental attribution error, but not as often as in individualistic
cultures.

Most of the research has to do with individuals deciding whether their actions are
influenced by their personality versus situational factors. It seems that they are. People

136

WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE

attribute the decisions of an “other group” to the individual member’s attitudes but attribute the decisions of their own group to the collective group rules.

PEOPLE CAN’T STOP IT EVEN WHEN THEY KNOW
THEY’RE DOING IT
Research shows that it’s very hard to stop making fundamental attribution errors. Even
when you know you’re doing it, and even if you know it’s not accurate, you’ll still make
the same error.

Hanna Zagefka (2010) asked people to read a ctitious news report about an island
ooding disaster. One group of people read a report that implied that part of the reason
for the ood was that the island’s dams were not built effectively. A second group read a
report that implied that the ood occurred because the storm was unusually strong and
didn’t mention the dams being built incorrectly. Participants in the rst group were less
willing to donate money than those in the second group.

fl

Similar results were found in another study about giving money to people affected by
the 2004 tsunami versus the civil war in Darfur. If the researchers emphasized that the
Darfur war was caused by ethnic con ict, then participants were less willing to donate
because they saw it as caused by humans.
Zagefka performed additional research and always found the same result. If participants
thought the disaster was man-made and that people could have done something differently, then participants were more willing to blame the people for the disaster.

Takeaways

Õ If you’re interviewing a subject matter expert or domain expert who’s telling you what
people do or will do, think carefully about what you’re hearing. The expert may miss
situational factors and put too much value on people’s personalities.

Õ Try to build in ways to crosscheck your own biases. If your work requires you to make a
lot of decisions about why people do what they do, you might want to stop before acting on your decisions and ask yourself, “Am I making a fundamental attribution error?”

60 FORMING OR CHANGING A HABIT IS
EASIER THAN YOU THINK

Have you ever heard that it takes 60 days to form or change a habit? Well, that’s actually not true. I used to write about that being true, but new research and a mindset shift
for me made me realize that habits can be very easy to create or change.
Whether you realize it or not, a lot of your daily behavior is composed of habits.
These are automatic behaviors that you do without thinking. You do them the same way
every day.
Think about all the habits that you don’t even remember trying to create. Perhaps you
put your keys in the same pocket when you walk out the door, or maybe you have a routine that you go through every weekday when you wake up.
You probably have routines around hundreds of things, for example:

7

7
7
7

How you get from your home to work
What you do as soon as you get to your place of work
How you clean your house or apartment
How you do laundry
How you shop for a gift for a relative
How you exercise
How you wash your hair
How you water your houseplants
How you take your dog for a walk
How you feed your cat
How you put your children to bed at night
And so on.

How did you end up with so many habits if they are so hard to create?
For most people most of the time, habits are created unconsciously, and they are carried out automatically. Habits help us all to do the many hundreds of things we need and
want to do in our lives. Because we can carry out a habit without having to think about it,
it frees up our thought processes to work on other things. It’s a clever trick that our brains
have evolved to make us more efficient.

138

WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE

Habits are actually another form of Pavlov’s classical conditioning. Here’s what we
know about the science of habits:
1.

If you want someone’s behavior to become habitual, then make the actions
they need to take very small and easy. For example, let’s say that you have a
new social media channel and you want people to make it a habit to go to the
app and check it often. You want that checking behavior to become a habit.
The first step, then, is to be sure that it is really easy and clear how to check
for activity in the channel. When they first use the app, send them a message
with a notification that shows up whenever there is activity.

2. Actions that involve physical movement are easier to “condition” into a habit.
Even a small physical movement, like a button press or a swipe on a cellphone, is enough of a physical movement to help set a habit. This is why the
apps that involve a physical movement (swiping, scrolling, clicking) become
habits so easily.
3. Habits that are associated with auditory cues, visual cues, or both will be
easier to create and maintain. This is why notifications cause certain apps to
become a habit.

Takeaways

Õ Give people a small, easy task to do rather than a complex one.
Õ Build in auditory cues, visual cues, or both.
Õ Include some type of physical movement (click, swipe, scroll).

PEOPLE ARE MORE MOTIVATED TO
COMPETE WHEN THERE ARE FEWER
COMPETITORS

Did you take standardized tests like the SAT and ACT to get into college? How many
people were in the room when you took the test? What does it matter? Research by
Stephen Garcia and Avishalom Tor (2009) shows that it may matter a lot. Garcia and
Tor first compared SAT scores for locations that had many people in the room taking
the test with locations that had smaller numbers. They adjusted the scores to control
for the educational budget in that region and other factors. Students who took the
SAT test in a room with fewer people scored higher. Garcia and Tor hypothesized that
when there are only a few competitors, you (perhaps unconsciously) feel that you can
come out on top, and so you try harder. And, the theory goes, when there are more
people, it’s harder to assess where you stand and therefore you’re less motivated to
try to come out on top. They called this the N effect, with N equaling “number,” as in
formulas.

COMPETING AGAINST 10 VS. COMPETING AGAINST 100
Garcia and Tor decided to test their theory in the lab. They asked students to complete a short quiz and told them to complete it as quickly and accurately as possible.
They were told that the top 20 percent would receive $5. Group A was told that they
were competing against 10 other students. Group B was told that they were competing against 100 other students. Participants in Group A completed the quiz significantly
faster than those in Group B—Group A had greater motivation knowing they were competing against fewer people. The interesting thing is that there was no one actually in
the room with them. They were just told that other people were taking the test.

BUILDING IN COMPETITION
If and when you are designing a product that has competition, whether it is software
for tracking sales for different members of the sales team or a game, if you are building in competition you may want to pay attention to what this research is saying about
competition.
It’s common to see products with leaderboards that list dozens or even hundreds
of names. To keep people motivated you may want to show only the top 10 on the
leaderboard.

WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE

Takeaways

Õ Competition can be motivating, but you can also overdo it.
Õ Showing more than 10 competitors can dampen the motivation to compete.

PEOPLE ARE MORE MOTIVATED TO COMPETE WHEN THERE ARE FEWER COMPETITORS

141

62 PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED BY
AUTONOMY

How many times in a typical day or week do you go to a self-serve website or product—
an ATM, the website to renew your car registration, or a banking app? How many products do you use that allow you to do things yourself rather than having to go through
another person?
You’ve probably heard people complain about self-service (“What happened to the
good old days when you could talk to an actual person?”), especially older people who
remember the days before self-service. But people actually like to be independent, to
feel that they’re doing things on their own with minimal help from others. People like to
do things the way they want to do them and when they want to do them. People like
autonomy.

N

Autonomy motivates people because it makes them feel in control
The unconscious part of the brain likes to feel that it’s in control. If you’re in control, then
there is less likelihood that you’ll be in danger. The “old brain” is all about keeping you
out of danger. Control equals keep out of danger equals do it yourself equals motivated
by autonomy.

Takeaways

Õ People like to do things themselves and are motivated to do so.
Õ If you want to increase the amount of self-service, make sure your messaging is about
having control and being able to do it yourself.

social interactions.

63 THE “STRONG TIE” GROUP SIZE LIMIT
IS 150 PEOPLE

You have people who you follow on your social media accounts, and people who follow
you. Then there are the colleagues you work with, people you know from community
organizations like schools and churches, your personal friends, and your family members. How many people are in your network overall?

DUNBAR’S NUMBER
Evolutionary anthropologists study social groups in animals. One question they have
been trying to answer is whether there is a limit on how many individuals different species can have in their social group. Robin Dunbar (1998) studied different species of
animals. He wanted to know if there was a relationship between brain size (specifically
the neocortex) and the number of stable relationships in social groups. He came up with
a formula for calculating the limit for different groups. Anthropologists call this Dunbar’s
number.

THE SOCIAL GROUP SIZE LIMIT FOR HUMANS
Based on his findings with animals, Dunbar then extrapolated what the number would
be for humans. He calculated that 150 people is the social group size limit for humans.
(To be more exact, he calculated the number at 148 but rounded up to 150. Also, there is
a fairly large error measure, so the 95 percent confidence interval is from 100 to 230—
for you statistics experts out there.)

N

Dunbar’s number holds across time and cultures
Dunbar has documented the size of communities in different geographic areas and
throughout different historical time frames, and he is convinced that this number holds
true for humans across cultures, geographies, and time frames.
He assumes that the current size of the human neocortex showed up about 250,000
years ago, so he started his research with hunter-gatherer communities. He found that
Neolithic farming villages averaged 150 people, as did Hutterite settlements, professional armies from the Roman days, and modern army units.

144

PEOPLE ARE SOCIAL ANIMALS

There’s a limit to stable social relationships
The limit specifically refers to the number of people with whom you can maintain stable
social relationships. These are relationships where you know who each person is and
you know how each person relates to every other person in the group.

DOES THAT NUMBER SEEM LOW TO YOU?
When I talk about Dunbar’s number of 150 for humans, most people think that is way
too low. They have many more connections than that. Actually, 150 is the group size for
communities that have a high incentive to stay together. If the group has intense survival
pressure, then it stays at the 150-member mark and stays in physical proximity. If the
survival pressure is not intense or the group is physically dispersed, then he estimates
the number would be even lower. This means that, for most of us in our modern society, the number would not even be as high as 150. In the world of social media, people
may have hundreds or even thousands of connections through a social media channel.
A Dunbar’s number advocate, however, would respond that these are not the strong,
stable relationships that Dunbar is talking about, where everyone knows everyone and
people are in proximity.

IS IT THE WEAK TIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT?
Some critics of Dunbar’s number say that what’s really important in social media is
not the strong ties that Dunbar talks about, but the weak ties—relationships that don’t
require everyone to know everyone else in the group and that are not based on physical proximity. (Weak does not imply less important in this context.) For example, our
social media connections are mainly weak ties.

PURPOSELY DESIGNING FOR STRONG OR WEAK
If you are building social or community features into a product, app, or service that you
are creating, you may want to stop and think about whether what you are building is
meant to be a strong-tie or weak-tie community. Are you assuming that people will connect with hundreds or thousands of people in the community? If so, then you are building a weak-tie community. Or perhaps you are planning smaller communities of 150 or
less? If so, then you are building a strong-tie community.
If it’s a weak-tie community, then numbers are important, and it’s not necessary for
everyone to know how everyone else is connected.
If it’s a strong-tie community, then assume that each person will have fewer than
150 connections, and consider showing how everyone in a person’s community is
connected.

An interview with Robin Dunbar
Here’s a video interview with Robin Dunbar: www.guardian.co.uk/technology/
video/2010/mar/12/dunbar-evolution.

Takeaways

Õ There is a limit of approximately 150 people for strong-tie groups. Weak-tie groups can
be much larger.

Õ If you are designing a product that has social connections or a community built in, think
about whether those interactions are for strong or weak ties.

Õ If you are designing for strong ties, you need to build in some amount of physical proximity and make it possible for people to interact, know each other in the network, and
know how everyone in their own network is connected.

Õ If you are designing for weak ties, don’t rely on direct communication among all people
in a person’s network or on physical proximity.

64 PEOPLE ARE HARD WIRED FOR
IMITATION AND EMPATHY

If you put your face right in front of a baby and stick out your tongue, the baby will stick
out his or her tongue too. This happens from a very young age, even as young as a
month old. So what does this have to do with anything? It’s an example of our built-in,
wired-into-the-brain capacity for imitation. Research on the brain shows how our imitative behavior works and how to use imitation in your products to influence behavior.

MIRROR NEURONS FIRING
The front of the brain contains an area called the premotor cortex (motor as in movement). This is not the part of the brain that actually sends out the signals that make you
move. That part of the brain is the primary motor cortex. The premotor cortex makes
plans to move.
Let’s say you’re holding an ice cream cone. You notice that the ice cream is dripping,
and you think that maybe you should lick off the dripping part before it drips on your
shirt. If you were hooked up to an fMRI machine, you would first see the premotor cortex
lighting up while you’re thinking about licking off the dripping cone, and then you would
see the primary motor cortex light as you move your arm.
Now let’s say it’s not you that has the dripping ice cream cone. It’s your friend. You
are watching your friend’s cone start to drip. If you watch your friend lift his arm and lick
the dripping cone, a subset of the same neurons also fire in your premotor cortex. Just
watching other people take an action causes some of the same neurons to fire as if you
were actually preparing to take the action yourself. This subset of neurons has been
dubbed mirror neurons.

Mirror neurons are the starting point of empathy
The latest theories are that mirror neurons are also the way we empathize with others.
We are literally experiencing what others are experiencing through these mirror neurons, and that allows us to deeply, and literally, understand how another person feels.

N

Mimicking other people’s body language makes them like you more
Watch two people talking. If you observe them closely, you will see that over time the
two people start to imitate each other’s body language. If one leans in, the other leans
in. If one touches his face, the other person touches his face.
Tanya Chartrand and John Bargh (1999) had people sit down and talk with someone (a
“confederate” who was actually part of the experiment, but the participants didn’t know
that). The confederates would vary their gestures and movements in a planned way.
Some confederates were told to smile a lot, others to touch their faces, and others to
jiggle their feet. The participants in the study would start to (unconsciously) imitate their
confederates. Some behaviors increased more than others. Face touching increased by
20 percent, but foot jiggling increased by 50 percent.
In another experiment Chartrand and Bargh had two groups. In one group, the confederate imitated the participant’s movements, and in the second group the confederate
did not imitate the participant. After the conversation, the participants were asked how
much they liked the confederate and how well they thought the interaction had gone.
The group in which the confederate had imitated the participant gave the confederate
and the interaction overall higher ratings than the group in which the confederate had
not imitated the participant.

V. S. Ramachandran’s research on mirror neurons
Vilayanur Ramachandran is one of the leading researchers on mirror neurons. I recommend that you watch this TED talk, in which he describes his research: http://bit.ly/
aaiXba.

Takeaways

Õ Don’t underestimate the power of watching someone else do something. If you want to
influence someone’s behavior, show someone else doing the same task.

Õ Research shows that stories create images in the mind that may also trigger mirror neurons. Use stories if you want to get people to take an action.

Õ Video at a website is especially compelling. Want people to get a flu shot? Then show

a video of people in line at a clinic getting a flu shot. Want kids to eat vegetables? Then
show a video of other kids eating vegetables. Mirror neurons at work.

65 DOING THINGS TOGETHER BONDS
PEOPLE TOGETHER

What do members of a marching band, fans cheering at a high school football game,
and people at church have in common? They are all engaging in synchronous activity.
Anthropologists have long been interested in rituals in certain cultures, such as drumming, dancing, and singing. Scott Wiltermuth and Chip Heath (2009) conducted a series
of studies to examine in more detail whether, and how, synchronous behavior affects
how people cooperate. They tested combinations of walking in step, not walking in
step, singing together, and other movements with groups of participants. What they
found was that people who engaged in synchronous activities were more cooperative
in completing subsequent tasks and more willing to make personal sacrifices in order to
benefit the group.
Synchronous activities are actions you take together with others, where everyone
is doing the same thing at the same time in physical proximity to one another. Dancing,
tai chi, yoga, singing, and chanting in time as a group are all examples of synchronous
activity.
Wiltermuth and Heath’s research also showed that you don’t have to feel good
about the group, or the group activity, in order to be more cooperative. Just the act of
doing the synchronous activity seems to strengthen social attachment among the group
members.

BONDING IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES

65

  

But how do you build in bonding for online communities? Some online communities are
synchronous or almost synchronous. Conference calls and multiplayer games are synchronous. Texting and messaging apps are often almost synchronous. But even if these
are synchronous communities, it might be hard to have the community engage in synchronous activities. Online communities don’t usually sing, drum, dance, or even clap in
unison.
This is a major reason why online communities don’t gel together as much as in-person
communities do.

DOING THINGS TOGETHER BONDS PEOPLE TOGETHER

149

N

Do people need synchronous activity to be happy?
In his article “Hive Psychology, Happiness, and Public Policy,” Jonathan Haidt (2008)
connects synchronous activity and mirror neurons with anthropology and evolutionary
psychology. Essentially his hypothesis is that synchronous activity promotes bonding
and therefore helps the group survive. Mirror neurons are involved in synchronous activity, and there is a certain type of happiness that humans can’t get any other way than
engaging in synchronous activity.

Takeaways

Õ Because most online interactions don’t take place with others in physical proximity,
there are limited opportunities for designers to build in synchronous activity.

Õ Possible opportunities to build synchronous activity into your product include using
live video streaming or a live video or audio connection.

PEOPLE ARE SOCIAL ANIMALS

66 PEOPLE EXPECT ONLINE

INTERACTIONS TO FOLLOW
SOCIAL RULES

When people interact with each other, they follow rules and guidelines for social interaction. Let’s say you’re sitting outside a café when your friend Mark sees you sitting by
the window. Mark comes over to you and says, “Hi Richard, how are you doing today?”
Mark expects you to interact with him, and he expects that interaction to follow a certain
protocol. He expects you to look at him—in fact, to look him in the eye. If your previous
interactions have been positive, then he expects you to smile a little bit. Next, you’re
supposed to respond to him by saying something like, “I’m fine. I’m sitting outside here
to enjoy the beautiful weather.” Where the conversation goes next depends on how
well you know each other. If you’re casual acquaintances, then he might wind down the
conversation: “Well, enjoy it while you can. Bye!” If you’re close friends, then he might
pull up a chair and engage in a longer conversation.
You both have expectations of how the interaction will go, and if either of you violates
the expectations, then you’ll get uncomfortable. For example, what if Mark starts the
conversation with “Hi, Richard, how are you today?” but you don’t respond? What if you
ignore him? Or you won’t look at him? What if you answered, “My sister never liked the
color blue” and stared into space? Or what if you responded with information that was
a bit too personal? Any of these scenarios would make Mark uncomfortable. He would
probably try to end the conversation as quickly as possible and avoid interacting with
you the next time the opportunity arose.

ONLINE INTERACTIONS HAVE THE SAME RULES

66

  

The same is true of online interactions. When you go to a website or use an app, you
have assumptions about how the product will respond to you and what the interaction
will be like. And many of these expectations mirror the expectations that you have for
person-to-person interactions. If the website is not responsive or takes too long to load,
it’s like the person you’re speaking to is not looking at you or is ignoring you. If the site
asks for personal information too early in the interaction, that’s like a person getting too
personal. If the app does not save your information from session to session, that’s like a
person not recognizing you or not remembering that you know each other.
Recently the public library in my county came out with a new app for borrowing
books online. I’m an avid reader and use the library a lot, so I was excited to try the app.
The first task it made me do was to select my local library branch from a list.

PEOPLE EXPECT ONLINE INTERACTIONS TO FOLLOW SOCIAL RULES

151

That doesn’t sound like a hard task,
except for two things: one, there are 456
local libraries to choose from, and two, the
list did not appear to be in any particular
order. So even though I knew the official
name for my library branch I couldn’t find it
on the list. After scrolling through 10 screens’
worth of library names, the screen in Figure 66.1 appeared.
Imagine that you walk into a library
and ask to borrow a book. The librarian
asks you to look at a long list of libraries
and choose the one you happen to be
standing in from the list. When you don’t
choose fast enough, he recites the words
in the picture above (including the very
long field of letters and numbers that you
are supposed to remember and then tell to
someone else).
This is not what the interaction with a
human librarian would be like. This screen
is definitely not following person-to-person
communication expectations.

Figure 66.1 This screen does not follow personto-person communication expectations

Takeaways

Õ When you’re designing a product, think about the interactions that the person will have
with it. Do the interactions follow the rules of a person-to-person interaction?

Õ Many usability design guidelines for products are actually guidelines that mimic

person-to-person interactions. Follow basic usability guidelines and you’ll be more
assured of meeting interactive expectations.

67 PEOPLE LIE TO DIFFERING DEGREES
DEPENDING ON THE MEDIUM

There are many ways to communicate: paper and pen, email, face-to-face meetings,
telephone, messaging. Some researchers have been interested in whether there are
differences in how honest we are based on the medium.

NINETY-TWO PERCENT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS LIED
Charles Naquin (2010) from DePaul University and his colleagues have conducted
research on honesty in people when using email versus pen and paper.
In one study, 48 graduate business students were each given $89 (imaginary money)
to divide with their partner; they had to decide whether to tell their partner how much
money there was and decide how much of the money to share with their partner. (There
wasn’t actually a partner; they just thought there was one that they were sending a message to.) One group (24 students) communicated by email, and the other group (the other
24 students) communicated by handwritten note. The group that wrote emails lied about
the amount of money (92 percent) more than the group that was writing by hand (63 percent). The email group was also less fair about sharing the money and felt justified in not
being honest or fair.

MANAGERS LIE TOO

67

  

Lest you think only the students would lie, Naquin and team performed additional studies with managers. One hundred and seventy-seven managers played a group financial
game. Participants were assigned to teams of three. Each member of the team had a
chance to play the role of a manager of a project team who was allocating money for
projects. They played with real money, and they were told that the amount of money
available would be revealed after the game. Some participants were told to communicate via email and others with paper and pen. The managers who communicated via
email lied more, and kept more money for themselves, compared to the managers who
communicated with paper and pen.

8

Harsher ratings on performance reviews
Terri Kurtzberg (2005) and her team did three studies to see whether people gave different performance review ratings if the reviews were done via email versus with pen
and paper. In all three studies participants gave more negative appraisals of their peers
when communicating via email than when using pen and paper.

PEOPLE LIE MOST ON THE TELEPHONE
At this point you might be thinking that emails are the worst in terms of lying. They’re
not. Jeff Hancock (2004) conducted a diary study. Using self-reporting, participants
admitted to lying most on the phone and least in email, with face-to-face and messaging interactions equal and in the middle of the other techniques.

N

The moral disengagement theory
Albert Bandura, a social psychologist from Stanford University, hypothesized that
people can and will become unethical as they distance themselves from the bad consequences of their actions. He called this the moral disengagement theory (Bandura,
1999). In discussing the results of his studies about email, Charles Naquin (2010) and his
team suggest that email causes that distancing because it is viewed as less permanent
and because people feel less trust and rapport.

How to tell who is lying in an email

fi

fi

Jeff Hancock (2008) reports that liars write more words (28 percent more) than people
who are telling the truth, and that liars use fewer rst-person references (I, me) and more
second- and third-person references (you, he, she, they). Interestingly, most people in
the research were not very good at guring out when they were being lied to.

DO PEOPLE LIE IN TEXT MESSAGES?
Madeline Smith’s research (2014) on lies in text messages shows that the rate for lying
in text messages is around 76 percent. She found that in texts, the lies are mainly about
oneself (for example, saying you can’t meet for lunch with someone because you are
working, when actually you aren’t working but you just don’t want to go to lunch with
that person). She found that almost everyone lies while texting, but about 5 percent of
people lie a lot—almost three times more than most.

154

PEOPLE ARE SOCIAL ANIMALS

Takeaways

Õ Most people lie frequently, and a small number of people lie a lot.
Õ People lie most on the phone and least with pen and paper.
Õ People are more negative toward others via email than with pen and paper.
Õ If you’re designing surveys via email, realize that people are likely to be more negative
than they would be using pen and paper.

Õ If you are conducting a survey or getting audience feedback, be aware that tele-

phone surveys will not get you as accurate a response as email or pen-and-paper
surveys will.

68 SPEAKERS’ BRAINS AND LISTENERS’
BRAINS SYNC UP DURING
COMMUNICATION

When you listen to someone talking, your brain starts working in sync with the speaker.
Greg Stephens (2010) and his team put participants in his research study in an fMRI
machine and had them record or listen to recordings of other people talking. He found
that as people listen to someone else talk, the brain patterns of both speaker and listener start to couple, or mirror each other. There’s a slight delay, which corresponds
to the time it takes for the communication to occur. Several different brain areas were
synced. He compared this with having people listen to someone talk in a language they
did not understand. In that case the brains do not sync up.

SYNCING PLUS ANTICIPATION EQUALS UNDERSTANDING
In Stephens’s study, the more the brains were synced up, the more the listener understood the ideas and message from the speaker. And by watching what parts of the brain
were lighting up, Stephens could see that the parts of the brain that have to do with
prediction and anticipation were active. The more active they were, the more successful the communication was. Stephens noted that the parts of the brain that have to do
with social interaction were also synced, including areas known to be involved in processing social information crucial for successful communication, such as the capacity to
discern the beliefs, desires, and goals of others. Stephens also hypothesizes that mirror
neurons are involved in the speaker-listener brain syncing.

Takeaways

Õ Listening to someone talk creates a special brain syncing that helps people understand what is being said.

Õ Presenting information through audio or video, where people can hear someone talking, is an especially powerful way to help people understand the message.

Õ Don’t just rely on reading if you want people to understand information clearly.

69 THE BRAIN RESPONDS UNIQUELY TO
PEOPLE YOU KNOW PERSONALLY

Your uncle Arden invites you over to watch the World Cup and tells you to bring some
friends. When you get there, you see several people you know (relatives and friends of
relatives) and some you don’t know. It’s a lively bunch, and over food and the game on
TV, lots of topics are covered, including soccer and politics. As you would expect, you
have similar opinions to some of your friends and relatives, and you disagree with some
of them. You actually have more in common, in terms of soccer and politics, with some of
the strangers you just met today than you have with some of your friends and relatives.
When it comes to the people in the room, you have essentially four possible connections, as shown in Figure 69.1.

FIGURE 69.1 The four possible connections with the people at the
World Cup party

69

  

The question that Fenna Krienen (2010) conducted research on is this: Does your
brain react differently to these four combinations? Do you make judgments about people
based on how similar they are to you? Or is it more important that they be close to you,
either a close friend or a relative? And if there are differences, will they show up on fMRI
brain scans? When you think about people who you don’t know but feel similar to, do the
same brain regions light up as though you were connected to them through kinship or
previous friendship?

THE BRAIN RESPONDS UNIQUELY TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW PERSONALLY

157

Krienen and her team tested these theories. They found that when people answered
questions about friends, whether or not they felt they were similar to their friends, the
medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) was active. The MPFC is the part of the brain that perceives value and regulates social behavior. When people thought about others that they
didn’t know but had common interests with, the MPFC was not active.

Takeaways

Õ All social media are not alike. It may be important to distinguish between social media
for friends and relatives and social media for people you’re not already connected to.

Õ People are “programmed” to pay special attention to friends and relatives. Social

media channels that include your friends and relatives will be more motivating and garner more loyalty than those for acquaintances or other purposes.

70 LAUGHTER BONDS PEOPLE
TOGETHER

How many times a day do you hear someone laugh? Laughter is so ubiquitous that you
don’t even stop to think about what it is and why people do it.
There’s less research on laughter than you might think. But a few people have spent
time researching it. Robert Provine is one of the few neuroscientists studying laughter.
He has concluded that laughter is an instinctual (not learned) behavior that creates social
bonding.
Provine (2001) has spent many hours observing when and why people laugh. He
and his team observed 1200 people spontaneously laughing in different locations. They
took notes on gender, situation, speaker, listener, and context. Here’s a summary of
what they found:

7
7

Laughter is universal. All humans in all cultures laugh.

7

Laughter is for social communication. People rarely laugh when they’re alone.
They laugh 30 times more often when they’re with others.

7

Laughter is contagious. People will smile and then start laughing as they hear
others laugh.

7
7

Laughter appears early in babies, at about four months old.

7
7

People rarely laugh in the middle of a sentence. It’s usually at the end.

7
7

Women laugh more than twice as much as men.

Laughter is unconscious. People can’t actually laugh on command—it will be
fake laughter if they try.

Laughter isn’t about humor. Provine studied over 2000 cases of naturally
occurring laughter, and most of it did not happen as a result of humor, such
as telling jokes. Most laughter followed statements such as “Hey, John, where
ya been?” or “Here comes Mary” or “How did you do on the test?” Laughter
after these types of statements bonds people together socially. Only 20 percent of laughter is from jokes.

The person who is speaking laughs twice as much as the person who is
listening.

Laughter denotes social status. The higher up on the hierarchy you are in a
group, the less you will laugh.

LAUGHTER BONDS PEOPLE TOGETHER

159

TICKLE LAUGHTER VS. JOY LAUGHTER
Diana Szameitat (2010) and her team studied laughter produced from tickling versus
laughter from other sources. They had people listen to recordings of people laughing while being tickled versus those laughing without tickling. When people listened
to regular laughter without tickling, they showed activity in the medial frontal cortex
of the brain. This is a region that is usually associated with social and emotional processing. When people listened to laughter during tickling, they showed activity in the
same region, but also activity in the secondary auditory cortex. Tickle laughter sounds
different.
The researchers think that laughter might have started in animals as a reflex-like
reaction to touch and then become differentiated over time through various animals and
species.

LAUGHTER AND TECHNOLOGY
One of the problems of communicating asynchronously (via email or messaging) is the
lack of hearing others laugh. If most of our communications with others, whether friends
or co-workers, is happening through a text medium, then we don’t hear the laughter of
others and the bonds are less formed.
In order for a group to form a close bond and stay closely bonded you will need to
build in opportunities to meet in person or at least to have audio calls where you can
hear each other laugh.

8

Other animals laugh, too
It’s not just a people thing. Chimps tickle each other and even laugh when another
chimp pretends to tickle them. Jaak Panksepp studies rats that laugh when he
tickles them. You can watch a video on YouTube showing Panksepp tickling rats:
http://bit.ly/gBYCKt.

160

PEOPLE ARE SOCIAL ANIMALS

Takeaways

Õ Many online interactions are asynchronous (email, messaging) and therefore don’t
afford a lot of opportunity for social bonding through laughing.

Õ Look for opportunities to at least have synchronous audio communication (phone

calls, teleconferences) so that periodically you can laugh together. This will bond the
relationship(s).

Õ You don’t necessarily need humor or jokes to get people to laugh. Normal conversa-

tion and interactions will produce more laughter than intentional use of humor or jokes.

Õ If you want people to laugh, then laugh yourself. Laughter is contagious.

PEOPLE CAN TELL WHEN A SMILE IS
REAL OR FAKE MORE ACCURATELY
WITH VIDEO

Research on smiling started as far back as the mid-1800s. A French doctor named Guillaume Duchenne used electrical currents with research subjects. He would stimulate
certain facial muscles and then take pictures of the expressions that people made (Figure 71.1). This was painful, and many of the pictures look like the people are in pain.

FIGURE 71.1 Guillaume Duchenne took photos of people
whose facial muscles were electrically stimulated

REAL OR FAKE?
Duchenne identified two different types of smiles. Some smiles involve contraction of
both the zygomatic major muscle (which raises the corners of the mouth) and the orbicularis oculi muscle (which raises the cheeks and makes the eyes crinkle). Smiles that
contract both of these muscle groups are called Duchenne smiles. In a non-Duchenne
smile only the zygomatic major muscle contracts; in other words, the mouth turns up,
but the eyes don’t crinkle.

162

PEOPLE ARE SOCIAL ANIMALS

After Duchenne, several researchers used these ideas to research smiling. For years
it was believed that Duchenne smiles were the ones that were seen as genuine and
that it was not possible to “fake” a smile, because up to 80 percent of people can’t consciously control the muscles around the eyes that make them crinkle. Why all the interest in whether a smile is real or fake? Because people are quicker to trust and like other
people who are showing what are believed to be genuine emotions rather than fake or
contrived ones.

QUESTIONING THE 80 PERCENT FIGURE
Eva Krumhuber and Antony Manstead (2009) decided to research whether it was true
that most people couldn’t create a fake smile that looks real. They found the opposite of
what was previously believed. In their research, when photos were taken of people pretending to smile, 83 percent of the people could produce fake smiles that other people
thought were real.
They also decided to test videos rather than just photos. What they found was that it
was harder to fake a smile in a video, but not because of the crinkly eyes. People could
tell real from fake by paying attention to other factors, such as how long they held the
smile and whether they saw other emotions besides happiness—for example, a flicker of
impatience. The video made it easier to detect a fake smile because it lasted longer and
was dynamic, instead of just a snapshot.

Takeaways

Õ If you are using a video to put across your message, pay attention to smiles. People will
be able to determine a fake smile versus a real one better in a video than in a photo. If
they don’t think the smile is real, they’re less likely to trust the person in the video, and
that may carry over to your brand or product.

Õ It is possible to fake a smile and to fake a crinkly-eye smile, but it is easier to fake a
smile in a static picture than in a video.

Õ People can tell whether a smile is real or not by looking for conflicting emotions. They
are looking at many parts of the face, not just the eyes.

71

  

Õ If a smile looks real, it will engage the viewer and build trust.

HOW

PEOPLE
FEEL

People don’t just think. They also feel. In addition to understanding your audience’s demographics, you need to also understand
their psychographics.

72 SOME EMOTIONS MAY BE UNIVERSAL
Considering how important emotions are in our everyday life, there’s not as much
research on them as you might think. Scientists studying emotions distinguish them
from moods and attitudes:

7

Emotions have physiological correlates, are expressed physically (through
gestures, facial expressions, and so on), result from a specific event, and
often lead to an action.

7

Moods last longer than emotions, perhaps a day or two. They may not be
expressed physically and may not come from a specific event.

7
7

Attitudes have a more cognitive, conscious brain component.
Joseph LeDoux (2000) has shown that certain parts of the brain activate
when people are feeling certain emotions.

THE CONTROVERSY: ARE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS UNIVERSAL?
Paul Ekman has written the books Emotions Revealed: Recognizing Faces and Feelings
to Improve Communication and Emotional Life (2007) and Telling Lies: Clues to Deceit
in the Marketplace, Politics, and Marriage (2009) and was a consultant to the Fox TV
series Lie to Me. He has identified seven emotions that he says are universal (Figure
72.1). Ekman believes that these emotions are recognized by everyone, regardless of
culture or geography.
Not everyone agrees with Ekman’s conclusions about the universality of emotions.
Rachel Jack’s research in 2012 showed possible differences in the recognition of emotions in facial expressions depending on geographic and cultural factors. Western participants in her research recognized the seven basic emotions formulated by Ekman,
but participants in the research from East Asia did not recognize all of those emotions in
the same way. Jack argues that some emotional expressions seem to be mediated by
culture.
Other researchers (Sauter and Eisner, 2013) disagree with the conclusions of Jack’s
research.

CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN HIGH EMOTIONAL AROUSAL VS. LOW

Nangyeon Lim’s research (2016) posits a different conclusion: Western cultures express
and recognize emotions that have a higher level of emotional arousal—for example,
fear, anger, alarm, delight, frustration, happiness, and tension. Eastern cultures express
and recognize emotions with a lower level of emotional arousal (for example, ease,
boredom, contentment, misery, relaxation, satisfaction, and sleepiness, among others).
So for now, there is not firm agreement about the universality of basic emotions.

Takeaways

Õ If you are designing for Western audiences, you can assume that your audience will

recognize Ekman’s seven basic emotions of joy, sadness, contempt, fear, disgust,
surprise, and anger. You can also assume that high-emotion expressions will be more
attention getting.

Õ If you are designing for non-Western cultures, then you may want to use images and
facial expressions that have less emotional arousal.

Õ You may want to research which emotions drive your particular target audience. In

addition to basic demographic information, identify and document psychographics;
for example, what emotions are motivating or will motivate different segments of your
target audience?

73 POSITIVE FEELINGS ABOUT A GROUP
CAN LEAD TO GROUPTHINK

You are part of a design team that works well together. The team has really gelled and
you feel great about being part of such a productive group that gets along.
All good, right? Well maybe not. In her paper describing the research on emotions
and decision-making, Jennifer Lerner (2015) discusses how being part of a team or group
that is functioning well can actually result in the group making poor decisions.
It is true that people like to be part of group that has a “shared sense of reality.” The
downside, though, is that people who are part of a well-working group tend to want to
minimize conflict. They don’t want to do anything or say anything that may disrupt the
good feelings and harmony.
This means that, sometimes, important issues are not dealt with, and difficult decisions are not made—or, if decisions are dealt with, those decisions might not be best in
the long run. It might have simply been a decision made to keep the group together and
strong.

Takeaways

Õ The more cohesive your team is, the more you need to watch out for “groupthink.”
Õ Establish debate and disagreement as social norms for the group. Use the power of

the group to create a new social norm that allows, indeed encourages, disagreement
and debate.

Õ Submit group decisions to an outsider’s review. Let someone outside the group review

73

  

the group decisions.

74 STORIES AND ANECDOTES PERSUADE
MORE THAN DATA ALONE

Let’s say you have to make a presentation to the department heads at work about your
latest conversations with your customers. You interviewed 25 customers and surveyed
another 100 and have lots of important data to share. Your first thought might be to
present a summary of the data in a numerical/statistical/data-driven format, for example:

7
7

75 percent of the customers we interviewed…
Only 15 percent of the customers responding to the survey indicated…

But this data-based approach will be less persuasive than anecdotes. You may want
to include the data, but your presentation will be more powerful if you focus on one or
more anecdotes; for example, “Mary M. from San Francisco shared the following story
about how she uses our product…,” and then go on to tell Mary’s story.
One of the reasons why anecdotes are more powerful than data is that anecdotes are
in story form. When you provide information in story form, the information is processed
differently. Different areas of the brain react to stories rather than data alone. Stories
evoke feelings and emotions, which causes the information to be remembered better
and longer.

Takeaways

Õ Information is processed more deeply and remembered longer if it is in story form.
Õ Look for ways to provide a message that will evoke emotions and empathy.
Õ Use anecdotes and stories in addition to data.

75 IF PEOPLE CAN’T FEEL, THEN THEY
CAN’T DECIDE

Botox is a popular cosmetic product used to reduce facial wrinkles. It’s injected into
various muscles (for instance, in the face) and paralyzes them, thereby causing the
wrinkles to relax. It’s been known for some time that a side effect of Botox treatments
is that people can’t fully express emotions (for example, they can’t move the muscles
that show they’re angry or even happy). New research shows that another side effect of
the injections is that people can’t feel emotions either. If you can’t move your muscles
to make a facial expression, you can’t feel the emotion that goes with the expression.
If you’ve recently received a Botox injection and you go to a sad movie, you won’t feel
sad because you won’t be able to move the facial muscles that go with feeling sad.
Moving muscles and feeling emotions are linked.
Joshua Davis (2010) from Barnard College and his team tested this idea. They
injected people with either Botox or Restylane. Restylane is a substance that, when
injected, fills out sagging skin but does not limit muscle movement like Botox does.
Before and after injecting the participants, they showed them emotionally charged
videos. The Botox group showed much less emotional reaction to the videos after the
injections.
David Havas (2010) instructed people to contract the specific muscles used in smiling. When the participants contracted those muscles, they had a hard time generating a
feeling of anger. When he instructed them to contract the muscles that are used to frown,
the participants had a hard time feeling friendly or happy.

NO EMOTIONS = NO DECISIONS
Antoine Bechara (1999) studied the relationship between emotions and decisions. In
his research he found that people who had damage to the parts of the brain involved in
feeling emotions were also unable to make decisions.

  

75

IF PEOPLE CAN’T FEEL, THEN THEY CAN’T DECIDE

171

N

The brain mirrors emotions too
When you observe someone who is feeling a certain emotion, the same parts of your
brain are active as in the brain of the person experiencing the emotion. An example is
the research of Nicola Canessa and her team (2009), who found that fMRI scans show
this effect with the emotion of regret. Participants watched someone perform a gambling task. When the person doing the gambling made a decision that caused them to
lose money, they felt regret, and certain parts of their brain were active during that feeling. When participants in the study watched people doing the gambling task, the same
regions in the brain were activated.

Takeaways

Õ You may need to consider the emotions you’re generating as people interact with your
product. For example, if someone reads a sad story and is frowning, this may put them
in a sad mood that might affect the next action they take.

Õ Watch out for unintended facial expressions that may change how people feel about

your product. For example, if the font on your website is very small and people are
squinting and frowning to read it, that may actually prevent them from feeling happy or
friendly, and that may affect an action you want them to take.

Õ If you want people to make a decision and take an action (for example, to register for

your newsletter or click a Buy button), you need to show them information, images, or a
video that triggers an emotion. They will be more likely to decide if they have an emotional experience.

76 PEOPLE ARE PROGRAMMED TO

In the chapter “How People Focus Their Attention” I talk about the role of the “old brain”
in scanning the environment for anything that could be dangerous. This also means that
the unconscious old brain is looking for anything new or novel.

CRAVING THE UNEXPECTED
Research by Gregory Berns (2001) shows that the human brain not only looks for the
unexpected but actually craves the unexpected.
Berns used a computer-controlled device to squirt either water or fruit juice into
people’s mouths while their brains were being scanned by an fMRI device. Sometimes
the participants could predict when they were going to get a squirt, but other times it
was unpredictable. The researchers thought that they would see activity based on what
people liked. For example, if a participant liked juice, then there would be activity in the
nucleus accumbens, the part of the brain that is active when people experience pleasurable events.
However, that’s not what happened. The nucleus accumbens was most active when
the squirt was unexpected. It was the surprise that showed activity, not the preferred
liquid.

Nice surprises vs. unpleasant surprises

fi

Not all surprises are equal. If, when you come home and turn on the light, your friends
yell “Surprise!” because it’s your surprise birthday party, that’s a very different kind of
surprise from nding a burglar in your home.
Marina Belova and her team (2007) researched whether the brain processes these two
different kinds of surprises in different locations.
The researchers worked with monkeys and the amygdala, a part of the brain where
emotions are processed. In their research they recorded the electrical activity of neurons in the amygdala. They used a drink of water (pleasant) versus a puff of air to the
face (which the monkeys do not like).
They found that some neurons responded to the water and others to the puff of air, but a
speci c neuron did not respond to both.

Takeaways

Õ If you want to grab attention, design something that is new and novel.
Õ Something unexpected not only gets attention but can also be pleasurable.
Õ Although a certain amount of consistency (at a website, for example) is a good thing

when people are trying to complete a task, providing novel and unexpected content
and interactions is good when you want people to try something new or when you
want them to come back to see what’s new.

77 PEOPLE ARE HAPPIER WHEN
THEY’RE BUSY

Consider this scenario: You’ve just landed at an airport and you have to walk to the baggage claim to pick up your luggage. It takes you 12 minutes to walk there. When you
arrive, your luggage is coming onto the carousel. How impatient do you feel?
Contrast that with this scenario: You’ve just landed at an airport, and the walk to the
luggage carousel takes 2 minutes. Then you stand around waiting 10 minutes for your
luggage to appear. How impatient do you feel now?
In both cases it took you 12 minutes to pick up your luggage, but chances are you are
much more impatient, and much unhappier, in the second scenario, where you have to
stand around and wait.

PEOPLE NEED AN EXCUSE
Research by Christopher Hsee (2010) and his colleagues shows that people are happier when they’re busy. This is somewhat of a paradox. In the “What Motivates People”
chapter, I wrote that we are lazy. Unless people have a reason for being active, they’ll
choose to do nothing, thereby conserving energy. However, doing nothing makes people impatient and unhappy.
Hsee’s team gave participants a choice: delivering a completed questionnaire to a
location that was a 15-minute round-trip walk away, or delivering it just outside the room
and then waiting 15 minutes. Some participants were offered the same snack bar regardless of which activity they chose, and others were offered a different type of snack bar
for the two options. (Hsee previously determined that both snack bars were considered
equally desirable.)
If the same snack bar was offered at both locations, then most (68 percent) of the
participants chose to deliver the questionnaire just outside the room (the “lazy” option).
The students’ first reaction was to do less work, but when they were given an excuse for
walking farther, most of them took the busy option. After the experiment, the students
who’d taken the walk reported feeling significantly happier than the idle students. In a
second version of the study, the students were assigned to either the “busy” or the “idle”
option (in other words, they did not choose). The busier students, again, reported higher
happiness scores.
In the next round of research, Hsee asked students to study a bracelet. Then he gave
them the option of either spending 15 minutes waiting with nothing to do (they thought
they were waiting for the next part of the experiment) or spending the same time taking
the bracelet apart and then rebuilding it while waiting. Some of the participants were

  

77

PEOPLE ARE HAPPIER WHEN THEY’RE BUSY

175

­

given the option of rebuilding it into its original configuration, and others were given
the option to reassemble the bracelet into a different design.
Participants who had the option of rebuilding the bracelet as it had been before
preferred to just sit idly. But the participants who were told they could reassemble the
bracelet into a new design preferred to work on the bracelet rather than sit idle. As
before, those who spent the 15 minutes busy with the bracelet reported feeling happier than those who sat idle.

Takeaways

Õ People don’t like to be idle.
Õ People will do a task rather than be idle, but the task has to be seen as worthwhile. If
people perceive it to be busywork, then they prefer to stay idle.

Õ People who are busy are happier.

78 PASTORAL SCENES MAKE
PEOPLE HAPPY

Walk into any hotel, house, office building, museum, art gallery, or other place where
there are paintings or photographs hanging on the wall, and chances are that you’ll see
a picture that looks something like Figure 78.1.

FIGURE 78.1 Pastoral scenes are part of our evolution

According to Denis Dutton, a philosopher and the author of The Art Instinct: Beauty,
Pleasure, and Human Evolution, you’ll often see these types of images because we’re
drawn to them due to our evolution during the Pleistocene era. (See Dutton’s TED talk at
http://bit.ly/cIj9uo.) Dutton notes that typical landscape scenes include hills, water, trees
(good for hiding in if a predator comes by), birds, animals, and a path moving through
the scene. This is an ideal landscape for humans, containing protection, water, and food.
Dutton’s theory about beauty is that we have evolved to feel a need for certain types of
beauty in our lives and that this pull toward things such as these landscapes has helped
us survive as a species. He notes that all cultures value artwork that has these scenes,
even people who have never lived in a geographical location that looks like this.

PASTORAL SCENES MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY

177

PASTORAL SCENES PROVIDE “ATTENTION RESTORATION”
Mark Berman (2008) and a team of researchers first had participants perform the backward digit-span task, which measures a person’s capacity to focus attention. Next,
participants were asked to do a task that would wear out their voluntary attention. After
that, some participants were asked to walk through downtown Ann Arbor, Michigan, and
some were asked to walk through the city’s arboretum. The arboretum has trees and
wide lawns (that is, it’s a pastoral environment). Following the walk, the participants did
the backward digit-span task again. Scores were higher for the people who had walked
through the arboretum. Stephen Kaplan (one of the researchers) calls this “attention restoration therapy.”
Roger Ulrich (1984) found that patients whose hospital window overlooked scenes of
nature had shorter stays and needed less pain medication compared to patients whose
rooms looked onto a brick wall.
Peter Kahn (2009) and his team tested nature scenes in the workplace. One group
of participants worked in an office where they sat near a glass window that overlooked
a nature scene. A second group saw a similar scene, but not out the window; instead,
they watched a video feed from a nature area outside. A third group sat near an empty
wall. The researchers kept measurements of the participants’ heart rates to monitor their
stress levels.
People who saw the video scene said that they felt better, but their heart rates were
actually no different from those who sat next to the wall. People in front of the glass
window actually had healthier heart rate measurements and were better able to recover
from stress.

Takeaways

Õ People like pastoral scenes. If you’re looking for a nature scene to use at a website, try
to pick one with pastoral elements.

Õ People will be drawn to, like, and feel happier looking at a pastoral scene online, but it
won’t have the same positive health effects as seeing the actual scene out a window
or being able to walk through the pastoral setting.

79 PEOPLE USE “LOOK AND FEEL” AS

THEIR FIRST INDICATOR OF TRUST

There isn’t much actual research on trust and website design. There are many opinions,
but not necessarily much real data. Research by Elizabeth Sillence (2004) and her team
provides some solid data, at least with regard to health websites.
Sillence researched how people decide which health websites to trust. Participants
in the study were all patients with hypertension. (In previous research, Sillence used the
topic of menopause and found similar results.) In this study participants used websites to
look for information about hypertension.
When participants in the study rejected a health website as not being trustworthy, 83
percent of their comments were related to design factors, such as an unfavorable first
impression of the look and feel, navigation, color, text size, or name of the website.
When participants mentioned the features that were relevant to their decision that a
website was trustworthy, 74 percent referenced the content of the site rather than design
factors. They preferred sites owned by well-known and respected organizations and
those that had advice written by medical experts, with information that was specific to
them and that they felt was written for people like themselves.

Trust is the biggest predictor of happiness
fi

If you want to know who is happiest, then gure out who feels the most trust. In his book

Seventy percent of the variability in happiness can be attributed to relationships

Interestingly, among all the variables, the best predictor of happiness is whether people
have trust (for example, trust in their country and trust in their government).

Takeaways

Õ People make quick decisions about what is not trustworthy.
Õ Design factors such as color, font, layout, and navigation are critical in making it
through the first “trust rejection” phase.

Õ If a website makes it through the first rejection cut, then content and credibility become
the determining factors as to whether the person trusts the site.

80 LISTENING TO MUSIC RELEASES
DOPAMINE IN THE BRAIN

Have you ever listened to a piece of music and experienced intense pleasure, even
chills? Valorie Salimpoor (2011) and her team conducted research that shows that listening to music can release the neurotransmitter dopamine. Even anticipating music can
release dopamine.
The researchers used positron emission tomography scans, fMRI, and psychophysiological measures such as heart rate to measure reactions while people listened to music.
The participants provided music that they said gave them intense pleasure and chills. The
range of music included classical, folk, jazz, electronica, rock, pop, tango, and more.

PLEASURE VS. ANTICIPATED PLEASURE
Salimpoor’s team saw the same pattern of brain and body activity when people were
listening to their music that they saw when people feel euphoria and craving while getting a reward. The experience of pleasure corresponded with dopamine release in one
part of the brain (the striatal dopaminergic system). When people were anticipating a
pleasurable part of the music, there was a dopamine release in a different part of the
brain (the nucleus accumbens).

Takeaways

Õ Music can be intensely pleasurable.
Õ People have favorite music that induces euphoria.
Õ Music is very individualized. What induces euphoria in one person may have no effect
for someone else.

Õ Anticipating the pleasurable parts of music activates different areas of the brain and
different neurotransmitters than actually listening to and experiencing the music.

Õ Allowing people to use or add their own music to a website, product, design, or activity is a powerful way to engage them. It also makes it more likely that they will want to
come back and engage again.

Õ Including video with music at a website can be engaging as well. Not only is the video
attention getting, it is a reason to include music.

81 THE MORE DIFFICULT SOMETHING

IS TO ACHIEVE, THE MORE PEOPLE
LIKE IT

You’ve heard about fraternities that have difficult initiation rituals to get in. The idea is
that if an organization is hard to get into, then the people in it like it even more than if
entry were not so difficult.
The first research on this initiation effect was done by Elliot Aronson at Stanford
University in 1959. Aronson set up three initiation scenarios (severe, medium, and mild,
although the severe was not really that severe) and randomly assigned people to the
conditions. He did indeed find that the more difficult the initiation, the more people liked
the group.

COGNITIVE DISSONANCE THEORY
Leon Festinger (1956) was the social psychologist who developed the idea of cognitive dissonance theory. Aronson uses this theory to explain why people like groups that
they had to endure hardship to join. People go through this painful experience only to
find themselves part of a group that is not all that exciting or interesting. But that sets
up a conflict (dissonance) in their thought process—if it’s boring and uninteresting, why
did I submit myself to pain and hardship? To reduce the dissonance, you decide that the
group is really important and worthwhile. Then it makes sense that you were willing to
go through the pain.

SCARCITY AND EXCLUSIVITY
In addition to the theory of cognitive dissonance to explain this phenomenon, I think
scarcity comes into play. If it’s difficult to join the group, then not very many people can
do it. If I might not be able to make it in, then I would lose out. So if I went through a lot
of pain, it must be good.

182

HOW PEOPLE FEEL

Takeaways

Õ I’m not suggesting that you make your website, product, or software application hard

to use so that people will feel pain and therefore like it more, although that is probably
accurate.

Õ If you want people to join your online community, you might find that people use it and

81

  

value it more when there are steps that have to be taken to join. Filling out an application, meeting certain criteria, being invited by others—all of these can be seen as barriers to entry, but they may also mean that the people who do join care more about the
group.

82 PEOPLE OVERESTIMATE REACTIONS
TO FUTURE EVENTS

Here’s a thought experiment. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being
the highest, rate how happy you are right now. Write that number down. Now imagine that
you win the lottery today. You now have more money than you ever thought you would.
You have millions and millions of dollars. What do you think your happiness rating would
be at the end of today? Write that number down. What do you think your happiness rating
will be two years from now if you win millions and millions in the lottery today?

PEOPLE ARE POOR PREDICTORS
In his book Stumbling on Happiness (2007), Daniel Gilbert discusses the research he
and others have conducted on predicting or estimating emotional reactions to events.
He has found that people greatly overestimate their own reactions to both pleasant
and unpleasant events in their lives. Whether it’s predicting how they’ll respond to a
negative event (such as losing a job, having an accident, or the death of a loved one)
or a positive one (such as coming into a lot of money, landing a dream job, or finding
the perfect mate), everyone tends to overestimate their reaction. If the event is negative, they predict that they’ll be very upset and devastated for a long time. If the event
is positive, they predict that they’ll be deliriously happy for a long time.

A BUILT-IN REGULATOR
What really happens is that you have a built-in regulator. Whether negative events happen or positive events happen, you stay at about the same level of happiness most of
the time. Some people are generally happier or unhappier than others, and this level of
happiness stays constant no matter what happens to them. This means that people are
not very accurate in their predictions of future happiness.

Takeaways

Õ People may prefer one thing over another or think that they will, but their reaction—be
it positive or negative—will probably not be as strong as they imagine it.

Õ Be careful of believing customers or users who tell you that making a particular change
to a product or design will make them much happier with it or cause them to never use
it again. They are likely overestimating their reactions.

Imagine you’re planning a trip with your sister to the Cayman Islands several months
from now. The two of you talk on the phone at least once a week, discuss the snorkeling you plan to do, and talk about restaurants that are close to the place you are staying. You look forward to the trip for a long time.
Contrast that with the actual experience of the trip, and you may find that the anticipation was better than the trip. In fact, Terence Mitchell (1997) and his team conducted
research on just such a situation. They studied people who were taking a trip to Europe,
a short trip over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, or a three-week bicycle tour of
California.
Before the event people looked forward to the trip with positive emotions, but during the trip their ratings of the trip were not that positive. The little disappointments that
always occur while traveling colored their emotional landscape to the point that they felt
less positive about the trip in general. Interestingly, a few days after the trip, the memories became rosy again.

Takeaways

Õ If you’re designing an interface where people are planning something in the future

(winning the lottery, going on a trip, arranging a business event, building a house),
they’ll have more positive feelings about the experience the longer you can draw out
the planning phase.

Õ If you measure satisfaction or other feelings, realize that you’ll get more positive ratings
when you ask people a few days after the interaction than when you ask them while
they’re interacting with the product or website.

Õ Alternatively, you’ll get better, more realistic data when you ask them during or right
after the interaction rather than asking their opinion several days or weeks later.

HOW PEOPLE FEEL

84 PEOPLE WANT WHAT IS FAMILIAR
WHEN THEY’RE SAD OR SCARED

It’s Friday afternoon and your boss calls you in to say that he’s not happy with your latest project report. This is the project that you repeatedly told him was in trouble and for
which you asked that more staff be assigned. You feel all your warnings were ignored.
Now he’s telling you that this work will reflect badly on you, and you may even lose your
job. On the way home you stop at the grocery store. You are sad and scared. Will you
buy the cereal you always buy, or will you try something new?

PEOPLE WANT WHAT’S FAMILIAR
According to research by Marieke De Vries (2010) of Radboud University Nijmegen, in
the Netherlands, you will buy the familiar brand. Research shows that people want what
is familiar when they are sad or scared. They are willing to try something new and different when they’re in a happy mood and not as sensitive to what is familiar.

THE DESIRE FOR THE FAMILIAR IS RELATED TO THE FEAR OF LOSS
This craving for the familiar and a preference for familiar brands is probably tied to the
basic fear of loss. In my book Neuro Web Design: What Makes Them Click? I talk about
the fear of loss. When people are sad or scared, the old brain and the mid-brain (where
emotions are processed) are on alert. They have to protect themselves. And a quick
way to be safe is to go with what you know. A strong brand is familiar. A strong logo is
familiar. When people are sad or scared, they’ll go for a brand and logo they know.

It’s easy to change someone’s mood

It turns out that it is remarkably easy to affect people’s moods, especially in the short
term (for instance, long enough for them to make a purchase at a website). In Marieke
De Vries’s research, participants watched video clips of the Muppets (puppets from
Sesame Street) to instigate a good mood and clips from the movie Schindler’s List (a
movie about Nazis and concentration camps in World War II) to instigate a bad mood.
People reported their mood as signi cantly elevated after the Muppets and signi cantly
lowered after Schindler’s List. This mood change then affected their actions in the rest of
the research study.

Takeaways

Õ Brands are a shortcut. If someone has had a positive experience with a brand in the
past, then that brand is a signal of safety to the old brain.

Õ Brands are just as important, or even more important, online. In the absence of being
able to see and touch the actual product, the brand becomes the surrogate for the
experience. This means that brands have a lot of power when people are making an
online purchase.

Õ Messages of fear or loss may be more persuasive if your brand is an established one.
Õ Messages of fun and happiness may be more persuasive if your brand is a new one.

MISTAKES

To err is human, to forgive divine.
—ALEXANDER POPE

People make mistakes. It’s impossible to build a system that is
impervious to human error. This chapter is all about the errors
that people make.

85 PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS MAKE

-

MISTAKES; THERE IS NO FAIL SAFE
PRODUCT

I collect computer error messages. It’s kind of a hobby. Some of them date back to the
old character-based computer screens. Most of them weren’t trying to be humorous;
they were written by computer programmers who were trying to explain what was going
wrong. But many of them end up being quite funny, and some of them intentionally so.
My favorite was from a company in Texas. When there was a “fatal” error, meaning the
system was going to crash, a message came up that said, “Shut ’er down, Henry, she’s
spewin’ up mud!”

ASSUME THAT SOMETHING WILL GO WRONG
The reality is that something always goes wrong: a user makes a mistake when entering data, a company releases software that has too many errors, or a designer develops
something that is unusable because he or she doesn’t understand what the user needs
to do. Everyone makes mistakes.
It is very difficult to create a system that is free of all errors and that guarantees that
people won’t make mistakes. In fact it’s impossible. The more costly the errors are, the
more you need to avoid them. The more you need to avoid them, the more expensive it
is to design the system. If it’s critical that people not make mistakes (for example, if you’re
designing a nuclear power plant, an oil rig, or a medical device), then be prepared. You’ll
have to test two or three times more than usual, and you’ll have to train two or three
times longer. It’s expensive to design a fail-safe system. And you will never fully succeed.

THE BEST ERROR MESSAGE IS NO ERROR MESSAGE
Error messages are probably the part of a device or software program that gets the
least amount of time and energy, and maybe that is appropriate. After all, the best error
message is no error message (meaning that the system is designed so that no one
makes errors). But when something goes wrong, it’s important that people know what to
do about it.

190

PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES

How to write an error message
Assuming that an error will occur and that you’ll need to inform the person using your
design, make sure that your error message does the following:

7
7
7
7
7

Tells the person what he or she did
Explains the problem
Instructs the person how to correct it
Is written in plain language using active, not passive, voice
Shows an example, if appropriate

Here is an example of a poor error message:
#402: Before the invoice can be paid it is necessary that the
invoice payment be later than the invoice create date.
Say instead, “You entered an invoice payment date that is earlier than the invoice
create date. Check the dates and reenter so that the invoice payment date is after the
invoice create date.”

Takeaways

Õ Think ahead to the mistakes that people are likely to make. Figure out as much as you

can about the kinds of mistakes people are going to make when they use what you’ve
designed. And then change your design before it goes out so that those mistakes
won’t be made.

Õ Create a prototype of your design and get people to use it so you can see what the
errors are likely to be. When you do this, make sure the people who are testing the
prototype are the same people who will be using it. For example, if the product is
designed for nurses in a hospital, don’t use your designers down the hall to test for
errors. You need to have nurses at a hospital test for errors.

Õ Write error messages in plain language and make sure to tell them what they did,

85

  

why there is an error, and what they should do to fix it. If appropriate, show them an
example.

86 PEOPLE MAKE ERRORS WHEN THEY
ARE UNDER STRESS

Once I was on a trip and found myself in a hotel room outside Chicago with my 19-yearold daughter moaning in pain. She’d been sick for a week, each day with a new symptom, but that morning everything got worse—her eardrum felt like it was going to burst.
Should I cancel my client meeting and take her to an urgent care clinic? Because I was
traveling, I was concerned that I was “out of network,” which would mean that I first
had to call my insurance provider to find out if there were any “in network” doctors we
could go to and still be covered by our plan. The customer service representative told
me to go to a particular website and said that any doctor we picked through that site
would be considered “in network.”

USING A WEBSITE UNDER STRESS
With my daughter still moaning in the background, I went to the URL I was given on the
phone. The first field on the first page had me stumped. The form asked for the type
of plan I had. Unsure, I left it at the default, which was Primary. I didn’t know what that
meant, but I decided to move on to the next field. My daughter was now moaning louder.
I filled in some more fields on the form and clicked the Search button. The screen
came back saying I’d made errors. I filled out the fields again, clicked the Search button
again, and again was told there were errors.
I went through this process several times. It was time for me to leave for my meeting.
What should I do? The more stressed I got, the more trouble I had filling in the form. I
gave up and gave my daughter some ibuprofen and a warm cloth for her ear. I turned on
the TV, handed her the remote, and went to my client meeting. I took her to a clinic later
that day when I could think clearly.
Several days later, when I was back home (and my daughter was feeling better), I
brought up the website again. Looking at it then, I decided there were some design and
usability issues, but overall, it wasn’t that confusing. When I was very stressed, however,
the web page was daunting, impossible to use, and not at all intuitive.

THE YERKES-DODSON LAW
Research on stress shows that a little stress (called arousal in the field of psychology)
can often help you perform a task, because it heightens awareness. Too much stress,
however, degrades performance. Two psychologists, Robert Yerkes and John Dodson
(1908), first postulated this arousal/performance relationship, and hence it has been
called the Yerkes-Dodson law for over a century (Figure 86.1).

Arousal (Stress)
FIGURE 86.1 The Yerkes-Dodson law

Arousal helps up to a point
The Yerkes-Dodson law states that performance increases with physiological or mental
arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance
decreases. Research shows that the optimal amount of stress/arousal depends on the
difficulty of the task. Difficult tasks require less arousal to reach optimal performance
and will start to break down if the arousal level is too high. Simpler tasks require more
arousal and don’t fall off as fast.

Tunnel action sets in
When arousal first goes up there is an energizing effect, as the person is paying attention. But as the stress increases there are negative effects. Attention gets unfocused,
people have trouble remembering, problem-solving degrades, and tunnel action sets
in. Tunnel action is where you keep doing the same task over and over, even though it
isn’t working, just like I was doing at the medical website.

Physical evidence of the Yerkes-Dodson law
Sonia Lupien and her team (2007) looked at the relationship of glucocorticoids—hormones
related to stress—and memory performance. The researchers found the same upsidedown U curve as the Yerkes-Dodson law when tracking the amount of glucocorticoids in
the bloodstream.

TASKS ARE MORE STRESSFUL THAN YOU MAY THINK
Don’t assume that people will use your product in a stress-free environment. Things that
may not seem stressful to you as a designer might be very stressful for the person using
your product in the real world. Assembling a toy at midnight on the night before a child’s
birthday party is stressful. Trying to fill out a form on a screen when a customer is present
on the phone or in person is stressful. Most medical situations are stressful. One of my
clients had people filling out a form for approving whether medical procedures would be
covered by insurance. “It’s just a form,” was what my client said. But when we interviewed
the people using the screens, they said they were very worried they would make a mistake on the form. “What if I make a mistake and someone doesn’t get a procedure paid for
as a result?” one of them asked. They felt a huge responsibility. It was a stressful situation.

8

Men and women may react differently to stress
Lindsay St. Claire (2010) and her team found that if men drank caffeinated coffee while
completing a stressful task, it impaired their performance. Women, on the other hand,
completed the task faster if they had been drinking caffeinated coffee.

8

Sweets and sex reduce stress
Yvonne Ulrich-Lai (2010) and her team fed sugar drinks to rats and measured their physiological and behavioral reactions to stress. The sugar drink calmed down the amygdala
and reduced stress hormones and the cardiovascular effects of stress. Sexual activity
did the same.

N

When the stakes go up, errors may appear

fi

Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees was set to hit his 600th career home run in the
summer of 2010. He hit number 599 on July 22, but then spent almost two weeks trying
to get one more to make it 600. And this was not the rst time he took a long time getting to the number he wanted. Back in 2007 he had the same problem getting from 499
to 500.
This is an example of making mistakes when the stakes are high—a typical problem when
dealing with well-learned skills and behaviors. When a skill is practiced and well learned,
it’s done primarily in an unconscious way. When the stakes go up, you tend to overanalyze. Overanalyzing a well-learned skill works for novices but causes errors for experts.

194

PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES

Takeaways

Õ If people are performing a boring task, then you need to raise the level of arousal with
sound, colors, or movement.

Õ If people are doing a difficult task, then you need to lower the level of arousal by eliminating any distracting elements such as color, sounds, or movement, unless they are
directly related to the task at hand.

Õ If people are under stress, they won’t see things on the screen, and they’ll tend to do
the same actions over and over, even if they don’t work.

Õ Do research to find out which situations might be stressful. Make site visits, observe
and interview the people who are using your product, determine the level of stress,
and then redesign if stress is present.

Õ If someone is an expert at a well-learned task, then performance stress may cause
errors.

87 NOT ALL MISTAKES ARE BAD
Dimitri van der Linden (2001) and his team conducted research on exploration strategies
that people employ when learning how to use computers and electronic devices. Van
der Linden’s idea is that errors have consequences but that, contrary to popular belief,
not all consequences are negative. Although it’s possible, and even likely, that making
an error has a negative consequence, it’s also likely that the error has a positive or a
neutral outcome.
Errors with a positive consequence are actions that do not give the desired result but
provide the person with information that helps him or her achieve an overall goal.
Errors with a negative consequence are those that result in a dead end, undo a positive consequence, send the person back to the starting point, or result in action that cannot be reversed.
Errors with a neutral consequence are errors that have no effect on task completion.
For example, let’s say that you’ve designed a new tablet device. You give people an
early prototype to see how usable the device is. They move the slider bar that they think
is the volume control, but instead the screen gets brighter. They’ve chosen the brightness slider rather than the volume slider. It’s a mistake, but now they know how to make
the screen brighter. If that’s a feature that they also need (and assuming they do eventually find the volume slider), then we could say that the error had a positive consequence.
Now let’s say that they’re trying to move a file from one folder to another, but they
misunderstand the meaning of the button choices and they delete the file instead. That’s
an error that has negative consequences.
Finally, they try to select a menu option that is not available. They’ve made an error,
but the consequence is neither positive nor negative—it’s neutral.

Takeaways

Õ Although you don’t want people to make lots of errors when using your product, errors
will occur.

Õ Since you know there will be errors, look for and document them during user testing.
Note whether each error consequence is positive, negative, or neutral.

Õ After user testing (and even before it), first concentrate on redesigning to minimize or
avoid errors with negative consequences.

196

88 PEOPLE MAKE PREDICTABLE TYPES
OF ERRORS

In addition to thinking about the consequences of errors, as in the van der Linden study
described previously, there is another useful error taxonomy. The Morrell (2000) taxonomy classifies two types of errors: performance and motor-control.

PERFORMANCE ERRORS
Performance errors are mistakes you make while you’re going through the steps to
complete a procedure. Morrell further divides performance errors into commission
errors, omission errors, and wrong-action errors.

Commission errors
Let’s say you’re trying to get a task done, such as turning on the Wi-Fi on your tablet.
All you have to do is touch the On/Off control on the screen, but you think that you also
need to touch the dropdown menu and select the network. That’s an example of a commission error: you took additional steps that were unnecessary.

Omission errors
Now let’s say that you’re setting up email on your new tablet. You enter your email
address and password. What you don’t realize is that you have to set up your outgoing
and incoming mail settings; you’ve only set up the outgoing ones. In this case you omitted steps; this is called an omission error.

Wrong-action errors
Let’s go back to setting up email. You enter your email and address, but you enter the
wrong server name for your email’s outgoing server. That is an example of a wrongaction error. You took an action at the appropriate point in the procedure, but it was the
wrong action.

MOTOR-CONTROL ERRORS

88

  

Motor-control errors are those you make while using the controls of a device. Let’s say
you’re trying to get used to using your fingers to rotate a picture on your tablet. But
instead of rotating the picture, you go to the next picture. In this case you’ve made a
motor-control error.
PEOPLE MAKE PREDICTABLE TYPES OF ERRORS

197

You may have different errors that you want to track as you design or conduct user
testing. It’s helpful to decide ahead of time which types of errors you think people will
make and which are important for you to detect and correct.

N

The Swiss cheese model of human error
In his book Human Error (1990), James Reason writes that errors have a cumulative
effect. Figure 88.1 starts with an error in the organization, which then leads to additional
errors in supervision, which leads to even more errors. Each error makes a hole in the
system until the end, when you have Swiss cheese (lots of holes), eventually leading to a
human error that is a mishap. Reason used nuclear power plant disasters as his example.

The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS)
In 2000, Scott Shappell and Douglas Wiegmann wrote a paper on HFACS for the U.S.
Office of Aviation Medicine. They worked from James Reason’s Swiss cheese model
and extended it to propose a system for analyzing and classifying human errors. They
focused on preventing errors in aviation, such as pilot error and control tower error. Figure 88.2 shows an example of the types of errors an HFACS can classify and analyze.

Takeaways

Õ People will make different types of errors in learning about and using your product.

Before you conduct user testing or user observation, decide which possible errors you
are most concerned about.

Õ During user testing and observation, collect data on which category of errors people
are making. This will help focus your redesign efforts after testing.

Õ If you’re in a field in which errors are not just annoying or inefficient but may actually

88

  

result in accidents or loss of human life, then you should use a system like HFACS to
analyze and prevent errors.

199

89 PEOPLE USE DIFFERENT ERROR
STRATEGIES

In addition to classifying the types of errors that people make, you can think about
the types of strategies that people use to correct an error. Neung Eun Kang and Wan
Chul Yoon (2008) conducted a research study to look at the types of errors that both
younger and older adults make when learning how to use new technologies. In their
study they identified and tracked different error strategies.

SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATIONS
When people use systematic exploration, they plan out what procedures they’ll use
to correct the error. For example, let’s say that they’re trying to figure out how to put a
song on a repeat loop. They try one item on a menu and that doesn’t work, so they set
out to see what each item in the menu does. They start at the first item in the first menu
and work their way through all the choices. They are exploring systematically.

TRIAL AND ERROR EXPLORATIONS
In contrast to systematic exploration, trial and error means that the person randomly
tries out different actions, menus, icons, and controls.

RIGID EXPLORATIONS
Doing the same action over and over even though it doesn’t solve the error is called
rigid exploration. For example, let’s say someone wants a song to repeat in a loop
and they touch an icon on the screen that they think should set the song to loop. But
it doesn’t work. They then choose the song again and touch the icon again. And they
keep repeating this combination of actions even though it doesn’t work.

200

N

Older adults complete tasks differently than younger adults
Kang and Yoon (2008) found no difference in completion rates for tasks due to age, but
older adults (those in their 40s and 50s) used different strategies than younger adults
(those in their 20s).

7

Older adults took more steps to get the tasks completed, mainly because they
made more errors as they went along, and they tended to use more rigid exploration strategies than did younger adults.

7

Older adults often failed to receive meaningful hints from their actions and
therefore made less progress toward the task goal.

7
7
7

Older adults showed more motor-control problems.

7

Older adults adopted more trial-and-error strategies than did younger adults,
but analysis of the data showed this was due not to age but to lack of background and experience with the type of device.

Older adults didn’t use their past knowledge as much as younger adults did.
Older adults had a higher level of uncertainty about whether their actions were
correct. They felt more time pressure and less satisfaction.

Takeaways

Õ People use different types of strategies in correcting errors. During user testing and

observation, collect data on which strategies your particular audience uses. This information will be helpful in predicting future issues and in redesign.

Õ Don’t assume that a population will be unable to finish a task just because they’re

older. They may do it differently and it may take more time, but they may be able to
complete as many tasks as younger people.

Õ In addition to thinking about younger versus older people, think about novices versus
experts. All older people are not the same. Just because someone is 60 years old
doesn’t mean they lack experience with technology. It’s possible for a 60-year-old to
be a computer geek who has used computers for a long time and has lots of knowledge. It’s also possible for a 20-year-old to have less experience with a particular
product, device, or software.

HOW PEOPLE

DECIDE
The way people decide to take an action is less straightforward
than we think. In this chapter we look at the science of how people make decisions.

90 PEOPLE MAKE MOST DECISIONS
UNCONSCIOUSLY

You’re thinking of buying a TV. You do some research on what TV to buy and then go
online to purchase one. What factors are involved in this decision-making process?
It may not be the process you think it is. In my book Neuro Web Design: What Makes
Them Click? I explain that people like to think that they’ve carefully and logically
weighed all the relevant factors before they make a decision. In the case of the TV,
you’ve considered the size of TV that works best in your room, the brand that you’ve
read is the most reliable, the competitive price, whether this is the best time to buy, and
so on. You’ve considered all those factors consciously, but research on decision-making
shows that your actual decision is made primarily in an unconscious way.
Unconscious decision-making includes factors such as:

7

What other people are deciding to buy: “I see that a particular TV got high
ratings and reviews at the website.”

7

What is consistent with your self-story: “I’m the kind of person who always has
the latest thing, the newest technology.”

7

Whether you can pay off any obligations or social debts with this purchase
(reciprocity): “My brother has had me over to his house all year to watch the
games. I think it’s time we had them over to our place to watch, so I’d better
get a TV at least as good as his.”

7

Fear of loss: “This TV is on sale, and if I don’t buy it right now the price may
go up and I might not be able to buy one for a long time.”

7

Your particular drives, motivations, and fears.

UNCONSCIOUS DOESN’T MEAN IRRATIONAL OR BAD
Most of our mental processing is unconscious, and most of our decision-making is
unconscious, but that doesn’t mean it’s faulty, irrational, or bad. We’re faced with an
overwhelming amount of data (millions of pieces of data come into the brain every second!), and our conscious minds can’t process all of it. The unconscious has evolved to
process most of the data and to make decisions for us according to guidelines and rules
of thumb that are in our best interest most of the time. This is the genesis of “trusting
your gut,” and most of the time it works.

204

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

Takeaways

Õ To design a product or website that persuades people to take a certain action, you
need to know the unconscious motivations of your target audience.

Õ When people tell you their reasons for deciding to take a certain action, you have to be
skeptical about what they say. Because decision-making is unconscious, they may be
unaware of the true reasons for their decisions.

Õ Even though people make decisions based on unconscious factors, they want a ratio-

90

  

nal, logical reason for the decisions they make. So you still need to provide the rational, logical reasons, even though they’re unlikely to be the actual reasons that people
decided to take action.

91 THE UNCONSCIOUS KNOWS FIRST
­

One of my favorite pieces of research on unconscious mental processing was conducted by Antoine Bechara (1997) and his team. Participants in the study played a
gambling game with decks of cards. Each person received $2000 of pretend money.
They were told that the goals were to lose as little of the $2000 as possible and to try
to make as much over the $2000 as possible. There were four decks of cards on the
table. Each participant turned over a card from any of the four decks and continued
turning over one card at a time from the deck of their choice until the experimenter told
them to stop. The subjects didn’t know when the game would end. They were told that
they earned money every time they turned over a card. They were also told that sometimes when they turned over a card, they earned money but also lost money (by paying
it to the experimenter). The participants didn’t know any of the rules of the gambling
game. Here are what the rules actually were:

7

If they turned over any card in decks A or B, they earned $100. If they turned
over any card in decks C and D, they earned $50.

7

Some cards in decks A and B also required participants to pay the experimenter a lot of money, sometimes as much as $1250. Some cards in decks C
and D also required participants to pay the experimenter, but the amount they
had to pay was only an average of $100.

7

Over the course of the game, decks A and B produced net losses if participants continued using them. Continued use of decks C and D rewarded participants with net gains.

The rules never changed. Although participants didn’t know this, the game ended
after 100 cards had been turned over.

THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND PICKS UP THE DANGER FIRST
Most participants started by trying all four decks. At first, they gravitated toward decks
A and B because those decks paid out $100 per turn. But after about 30 turns, most
turned to decks C and D. They then continued turning cards in decks C and D until the
game ended. During the study, the experimenter stopped the game several times to
ask participants about the decks. The participants were connected to a skin conductance sensor to measure their skin conductance response (SCR). The participants’ SCR
readings were elevated when they played decks A and B (the “dangerous” decks) long
before they consciously realized that A and B were dangerous. Their SCRs increased
when they thought about choosing the A and B decks before they even touched them.

206

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

The unconscious knew that decks A and B were “dangerous” and would result in a loss.
This was evidenced by the spike in the SCR. However, that’s all unconscious. Their conscious minds didn’t yet know that anything was wrong.
Eventually participants said they had a hunch that decks C and D were better, but the
SCR shows that the unconscious figured this out long before the information reached
consciousness. By the end of the game, most participants had more than a hunch and
could articulate the difference in the two decks, but a full 30 percent of the participants
couldn’t explain why they preferred decks C and D. They said they just thought those
decks were better.

Takeaways

Õ People respond and react to unconscious signals of danger.
Õ The unconscious acts more quickly than the conscious mind. This means that

people often take actions or have preferences but cannot explain why they prefer
what they do.

92 PEOPLE WANT MORE CHOICES AND
INFORMATION THAN THEY CAN
PROCESS

If you stand in any aisle in any retail store in the U.S., you’ll be inundated with choices.
Whether you’re buying candy, cereal, TVs, or jeans, you’ll likely have a huge number of
items to choose from. Whether it’s a retail store or a website, if you ask people if they’d
prefer to choose from a few alternatives or have lots of choices, most people will say
they want lots of choices.

TOO MANY CHOICES PARALYZES THE THOUGHT PROCESS
Sheena Iyengar’s book The Art of Choosing (2010) details her own and others’ research
on choice. In graduate school Iyengar conducted what is now known as the “jam” study.
Iyengar and Mark Lepper (2000) decided to test the theory that people who have too
many choices will not choose at all. They set up booths at a busy upscale grocery store
and posed as store employees. They alternated the selection on the table. Half of the
time there were six choices of fruit jam for people to try, and the other half of the time
there were twenty-four jars of jam.

Which table had more visitors?
When there were twenty-four jars of jam, 60 percent of the people coming by would stop
and taste. When there were six jars of jam, only 40 percent of the people would stop and
taste. So having more choices was better, right? Not really.

Which table resulted in more tasting?
You might think that people would taste more jam when the table had twenty-four varieties. But they didn’t. People stopped at the table, but they tasted only a few varieties
whether there were six or twenty-four choices available. People can remember only
three or four things at a time (see the chapter “How People Remember”); likewise, they
can decide from among only three or four things at a time.

Which table resulted in more purchases?
The most interesting part of Iyengar’s study is that 31 percent of the people who
stopped at the table with six jars actually made a purchase. But only 3 percent of the
people who stopped at the table with twenty-four jars actually made a purchase. So

208

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

even though more people stopped by, fewer people purchased. To give you an example of the numbers, if 100 people came by (they actually had more than that in the study,
but 100 makes the calculations easy for our purposes), 60 of them would stop and try
the jam at the twenty-four-jar table, but only two would make a purchase. Forty people
would stop and try the jam at the six-jar table, and twelve of them would actually make a
purchase.

WHY PEOPLE CAN’T STOP
So if “less is more,” then why do people always want more choices? It’s part of that
dopamine effect. People want more information. It’s only when people are confident in
their decisions that they stop seeking more information.

Takeaways

Õ Resist the impulse to provide your customers with a large number of choices.
Õ If you ask people how many options they want, they will almost always say “a lot” or

“give me all the options.” So if you ask, be prepared to deviate from what they ask for.

Õ If possible, limit the number of choices to three or four. If you have to offer more

options, try to do so in a progressive way. For example, have people choose first from
three or four options, and then choose again from a subset.

PEOPLE WANT MORE CHOICES AND INFORMATION THAN THEY CAN PROCESS

209

93 PEOPLE THINK CHOICE EQUALS
CONTROL

In The Art of Choosing (2010), Sheena Iyengar describes an experiment with rats. The
rats were given a choice between a direct path to food and a path that had branches
and therefore required choices to be made. Both paths resulted in access to the same
food in the same amounts. If rats only wanted food, then it seems logical that they
would take the short, direct path. But the rats continuously preferred the path with
branches.
In experiments with monkeys and pigeons, the animals learn to press buttons to get
food. When given a choice between one button and multiple buttons, both monkeys and
pigeons prefer multiple buttons.
In similar research with humans, people were given chips to use at a casino. They
could use the chips at a table that had one roulette wheel or at a table where they could
choose from two roulette wheels. People preferred the table with two wheels, even
though all three wheels were identical.
Even though it isn’t necessarily true, people equate having choices with having control. For people to feel they are in control, they need to feel that their actions are powerful and that they have choices to make. Sometimes having many choices makes it harder
to get what they want, but they still want those choices so that they feel in control of the
decisions.
People have an innate desire to control their environment. This makes sense, since
by controlling the environment, they likely increase their chances of surviving.

N

The need to control starts young
Iyengar describes a study of infants as young as four months old in which the researchers attached the babies’ hands to a string. The infants could move their hands to pull the
string, which would cause music to play. Then the researchers detached the string from
the music control. They would play music at the same intervals, but the infant had no
control over when the music would play. The babies would exhibit sadness and anger,
even though the music was still playing at the same intervals. They wanted to control
when the music played.

210

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

Takeaways

Õ People need to feel that they’re in control and that they have choices.
Õ People won’t always choose the fastest way to complete a task. When you’re deciding
how your audience will accomplish a task with your website or product, you may want
to offer more than one way, even if the alternative methods are less efficient, just so
that people will have a choice.

Õ Once you’ve given people choices, they’ll be unhappy if you take those choices away.
If a new version of your product includes improved methods for accomplishing tasks,
you may want to leave some of the older methods in the product so that people feel
they have options.

94 PEOPLE MAY CARE ABOUT TIME MORE
THAN THEY CARE ABOUT MONEY

Say you’re out for a Sunday bike ride on your favorite path, and you come across some
kids selling lemonade. Do you stop and buy lemonade? Do you like the lemonade?
Does your buying or liking the lemonade have anything to do with the wording on the
sign next to the lemonade stand? Apparently so.
Cassie Mogilner and Jennifer Aaker (2009) from the Stanford Graduate School of
Business conducted a series of experiments to see whether references to time or to
money would affect whether people stopped to buy, how much they were willing to
pay, and how satisfied they were with the products they bought. They conducted five
experiments.

SPENDING TIME VS. SPENDING MONEY
The first study was the lemonade stand previously described. Sometimes there was a
sign that said, “Spend a little time, and enjoy C & D’s lemonade.” This was the “time”
condition. Sometimes the sign said, “Spend a little money, and enjoy C & D’s lemonade”
(money condition), and other times the sign said, “Enjoy C & D’s lemonade” (control
condition).
A total of 391 people passed by either on foot or on bikes. Those who stopped to
purchase lemonade ranged in age from 14 to 50, and there was a mix of gender and
occupations. Customers could pay anywhere from $1 to $3 for a cup of lemonade—the
customer decided on the price. The authors comment that the high price was justified
by the fact that the customers got to keep the high-quality plastic cup. After customers
drank their lemonade, they completed a survey.
More people stopped to buy lemonade when the sign mentioned time (14 percent).
In fact, twice as many people stopped when time was mentioned as when money was
mentioned (7 percent). In addition, customers in the time condition paid more money for
the lemonade ($2.50 on average) compared to the money condition ($1.38 on average).
Interestingly, the control condition was in between on both the number of people stopping to purchase and the average price. In other words, mentioning time brought the
most customers and the most money, mentioning money brought the fewest customers
and the least money, and mentioning neither was in between. The same was true when
customers filled out the satisfaction survey.
The researchers came up with the hypothesis that when you invoke time in the message, you make more of a personal connection than when you invoke money. To test this
idea, they conducted four more experiments in the lab rather than in the field to see how
the messaging affected people’s ideas about purchasing electronics, jeans, and cars.

212

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

PEOPLE WANT TO CONNECT
At the end of all the experiments, the researchers concluded that people are more willing to buy, are willing to spend more money, and like their purchases better if there’s
a personal connection. In most cases, that personal connection is triggered by references to time instead of money. The idea is that mentioning time highlights your experience with the product, and this thinking about the experience makes the personal
connection.
However, for certain products (such as designer jeans or prestige cars) and for certain consumers (those who value possessions more than experiences), personal connection is better highlighted by mentioning money more than by mentioning time. These
people are in the minority, but they are out there.

Takeaways

Õ The best thing to do, of course, is to know your market or audience. If they’re influenced by prestige and possessions, then by all means mention money.

Õ Be aware that most people, most of the time, are more influenced by time and experiences that produce a personal connection than by money or possessions.

Õ If you don’t have the time or budget to know your audience well and if you’re selling

94

  

nonprestige items or services, then err on the side of time and experiences, and delay
the mention of money as long as possible in the flow of the task you are designing.

95 MOOD INFLUENCES THE DECISION
MAKING PROCESS

You have just been offered a new job. The work is interesting, and there’s more money,
but there are downsides too. You’ll probably have to travel more and work longer hours.
Should you take the new job or stay where you are? Your gut tells you to go for it, but
when you sit down and make a list of pros and cons, the cons outweigh the pros, and
the logical method tells you to stay put. Which will you follow: your gut or your logic?
Marieke de Vries (2008) and her team conducted research to find out. They were
interested in the intersection between mood and decision-making strategies.
Participants were shown a video clip of a funny part from a Muppets movie (happy
mood) or a clip from the movie Schindler’s List (sad mood). Next they were shown some
Thermos products (products that keep food or beverages hot or cold). Some participants
were told to choose which Thermos they’d like to win in a lottery based on their first feeling (intuitive condition). Other participants were instructed to evaluate the different products in terms of the pros and cons of their features and attributes (deliberative condition).
After the participants chose the Thermos they preferred, they estimated the monetary value of their Thermos. Next they filled out a questionnaire that measured their
current mood and lastly filled out a questionnaire that rated their usual style of decisionmaking, intuitive or deliberative.
Here is a summary of their results:

214

7
7

The video clips worked in terms of getting people into a happy or sad mood.

7

Participants who usually make deliberative decisions estimated the value of
the Thermos higher when given deliberate instructions.

7

Participants in a happy mood estimated the value of the Thermos higher
when making an intuitive decision, regardless of their usual decision-making
style.

7

Participants in a sad mood estimated the value of the Thermos higher when
making a deliberative decision, regardless of their usual decision-making
style.

7

There were no gender differences.

Participants who usually make intuitive decisions estimated the value of the
Thermos higher when given intuitive instructions.

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

Takeaways

Õ Some people tend to make decisions intuitively, and others tend to make them in a
deliberate way.

Õ People will estimate a product to be of higher value if they can make the decision in
their “natural” style.

Õ If you can find out someone’s style, you can suggest to them how to make a decision,
and that will result in a higher estimation of the value of a product.

Õ You can influence someone’s mood easily with, for example, a short video clip.
Õ People in a good mood will rate a product as being more valuable if they are asked to
make the decision quickly based on their first feelings.

Õ People in a sad mood will rate a product as being more valuable if they are asked to
make the decision in a more deliberate way.

Õ If you influence people’s mood, then you can suggest to them how to think about their
decision-making process. This will result in a higher estimation of the value of a product or service.

MOOD INFLUENCES THE DECISION- MAKING PROCESS

96 YOU CAN ENGINEER BETTER GROUP
DECISIONS

Walk into any office building in the world and you’ll find the conference rooms filled with
groups of people meeting and making decisions. Every day, thousands of decisions
in businesses and organizations are made by groups large and small. Unfortunately,
research shows that group decision-making has serious flaws. But there are some relatively simple steps that improve group decisions.

THE DANGER OF GROUPTHINK
Andreas Mojzisch and Stefan Schulz-Hardt (2010) presented people with information on
prospective job candidates. Everyone received and reviewed the information on their
own first, not together in a face-to-face group. One set of participants received information on the preferences of the other people in the group before they began the review
of the material, and another set of participants did not receive information on the preferences of the group before their review. Everyone then received the same information
on the candidates. To make the best decision, participants would have had to review all
the information given to them.
The researchers found that people who received information on the group’s preferences before reviewing the candidate information did not review the candidate information fully and therefore did not make the best decisions. In a memory test, they did not
remember the most relevant information. The researchers concluded that when a group
of people starts a discussion by sharing their initial preferences, they spend less time
and less attention on the information available outside the group’s preferences. And they
therefore make a less than optimal decision.
Mojzisch and Schulz-Hardt did a follow-up study in which they changed the situation
so that the group was together face-to-face. In this study, each group member had different information about the potential job candidates. They could reach the best decision
only if all the group members shared their unique information. Again, if the group started
by talking about their initial preferences, they paid less attention to the relevant information during the discussion and made the wrong decision.

216

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

8

Ninety percent of group discussions start off on the wrong foot
Ninety percent of group discussions start with group members talking about their initial
impressions. The research is clear that this is a poor idea; instead, by starting the discussion with relevant information, this data will be weighed more carefully for a better
decision.

BUT TWO PEOPLE CAN BE BETTER THAN ONE
The wide receiver catches the football right at the corner of the end zone. Is it a touchdown or not? Two referees saw the play from two different angles. Are they more likely
to make a correct decision if they talk about it or if they decide individually? Research
by Bahador Bahrami shows that “two heads are better than one” if they talk together
and if they are both competent in their knowledge and skills.
Bahrami (2010) and his team found that pairs do better than individuals at making
decisions as long as they freely discuss their disagreements, not only about what they
saw but also about how confident they are about what they saw. If they aren’t allowed to
freely discuss and they just give their decision, then the pair does not make better decisions than an individual would.

Takeaways

Õ Give people a way and time to consider all relevant information on their own before
they see what other people think.

Õ Ask people to rate how confident they are in their decision before they show that decision to others.

Õ Once opinion-sharing starts, make sure people have enough time to discuss their
disagreements.

Õ It’s easy for people to share information ahead of time and for that information to be

96

  

widely disseminated. But this free flow of information and opinions may mean that
people are collectively making poorer decisions. Encourage people to wait until the
meeting before sharing opinions.

97 PEOPLE MAKE HABIT BASED
-

DECISIONS OR VALUE BASED
DECISIONS, BUT NOT BOTH AT THE
SAME TIME

Kelly is in charge of choosing IT cloud services at her company. Two years ago she
signed the company up for a chatbot service. There are three levels of service: Free,
Professional, and Enterprise. Kelly has signed up for the Professional level each year
so far.
It’s time for the annual renewal. Will she renew? Will she decide to renew but switch
to the free service? Will she decide to upgrade to the Enterprise level? Is there anything
about the email notice or web page for the service that will either encourage her or discourage her from renewing or influence her decision about which level to choose?

HABIT-BASED DECISIONS VS. VALUE-BASED DECISIONS
There are two different types of decisions that people make: habit-based decisions and
value-based decisions.
Habit-based decisions occur in the basal ganglia (deep in the brain). When you pull
your usual cereal off the shelf at the grocery store and put it in your cart without even
thinking about it, that’s a habit-based decision.
If Kelly presses the Renew button for the chatbot software without even considering
whether to change the level of service, then she is making a habit-based decision.
Value-based decisions are made in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) area in the brain.
This is where logical thinking and mental activities having to do with planning and comparing occur. You are engaging in value-based decisions when you compare which
brand of car you should buy or whether you have enough money to buy a new car rather
than a used car.
If Kelly were comparing the features of the different levels for the chatbot service,
then she would be making a value-based decision.

ONLY ONE OR THE OTHER
If the OFC is quiet, then the habit part of the brain takes over. This means that people
are making either a value-based decision or a habit-based decision, but not both at the
same time.
If you give someone a lot of information, then they will switch from a habit-based
decision to a value-based decision. If you want someone to make a habit-based

218

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

decision, don’t give them too much information to review. If you want them to make a
value-based decision, then do give them information to review.
If you want Kelly to renew for the Professional level again, then don’t give her lots of
information. Let her make the habit-based decision to renew.
If, however, you are hoping that she will go up a level (not down), then you may want
to give her information on her options, as that will kick her from a habit-based decision to
a value-based decision.

Takeaways

Õ Habit-based and value-based decisions occur in different parts of the brain.
Õ When the OFC is quiet—that is, when someone is not making a value-based decision—
then the habit part of the brain becomes active.

Õ If you want someone to make a habit-based decision, do not give them a lot of
information.

Õ If you want someone to make a value-based decision, give them more information.

98 WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNCERTAIN, THEY
LET OTHERS DECIDE WHAT TO DO

Imagine you’re browsing a website to decide what boots to buy. You see a pair that
looks good, but you’ve never heard of the brand before. Will you buy the boots or not?
If you’re unsure, then chances are you’ll scroll down the page and look for reviews and
ratings left by others. And chances are the reviews will influence your decision, even
though the people writing the reviews are total strangers.

UNCERTAINTY TIPS THE SCALE
In my book Neuro Web Design: What Makes Them Click? I talk about the tendency to
look to others to decide what to do. It’s called social validation.
Bibb Latane and John Darley (1970) conducted research in which they set up ambiguous situations to see if people were affected by what others around them were or were
not doing. Participants in the research would go into a room, supposedly to fill out a survey on creativity. In the room would be one or more other people pretending they were
also participants, but who were really part of the experiment. Sometimes there would
be one other person in the room, sometimes more. While people were filling out their
creativity survey, smoke would start to come into the room from an air vent. Would the
participant leave the room? Go tell someone about the smoke? Just ignore it?

PEOPLE TAKE ACTION ONLY IF OTHERS TAKE ACTION
What action, if any, the participant took depended on the behavior of the other people
in the room, as well as how many other people there were. The more people, and the
more the others ignored the smoke, the more the participant was likely to do nothing.
If the participant was alone, he or she would leave the room and notify someone. But
if there were others in the room and they didn’t react, then the participant would do
nothing.

TESTIMONIALS AND RATINGS ARE POWERFUL
Social validation through testimonials, ratings, and reviews will influence behavior.
When people are unsure about what to do or buy, they look to testimonials, ratings, and
reviews to tell them how to behave.

Reviews by “regular people like me” are the most influential

fl

Yi-Fen Chen (2008) researched three kinds of ratings and reviews at a bookstore website: reviews by regular visitors to a website, experts on the topic, and recommendations
from the website itself. All three types in uenced behavior, but the reviews by regular
visitors were the most in uential.

Takeaways

Õ People are very influenced by others’ opinions and behaviors, especially when they
are uncertain.

Õ Use testimonials, ratings, and reviews if you want to influence behavior.
Õ The more information you provide in the rating and review about the person who left it,
the more influential the rating or review will be, especially when the description makes
the reader feel that this person is “someone like me.”

  

98

WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNCERTAIN, THEY LET OTHERS DECIDE WHAT TO DO

221

99 PEOPLE THINK OTHERS ARE MORE

EASILY INFLUENCED THAN THEY ARE
THEMSELVES

When I give talks about social validation—how much people are influenced by other
people’s behavior, such as that regarding ratings and reviews in the previous topic—
everyone in the room nods and talks about how it’s true that other people are very
influenced by ratings and reviews. However, most people I speak to think that they
themselves are not very affected. I talk about how much we’re affected by pictures,
images, and words, and that we don’t realize we’re being influenced. And the reaction
is always similar: “Yes, other people are affected by these things, but I’m not.”

THE THIRD-PERSON EFFECT
In fact, this belief that “others are affected but not me” is so common that there is
research on it, and it has its own name: the third-person effect. The research shows
that most people think others are influenced by persuasive messages but that they
themselves are not. The research shows that this perception is false. The third-person
effect seems to be especially true if you think you aren’t interested in the topic. For
example, if you’re not in the market to buy a new TV, then you’ll tend to think that advertising about new TVs won’t affect you, but the research says that it will.

WHY DO PEOPLE DECEIVE THEMSELVES THIS WAY?
Why the self-deception? It’s partly because all this influence is happening unconsciously. People are literally unaware that they’re being influenced. And it’s also partly
because people don’t like to think of themselves as easily swayed, or gullible. To be
gullible is to not be in control, and the old brain—the part that is concerned with survival—always wants us to be in control.

222

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

Takeaways

Õ Everyone is affected by unconscious processes.
Õ If you’re doing customer research and people say, “Ratings and reviews don’t influence

99

  

my decision,” don’t believe what they’re saying. Remember that these are unconscious
processes, and people are largely unaware of what is affecting them. Watch their
behavior, instead of just listening to what they think their behavior is.

100 PEOPLE VALUE A PRODUCT MORE
HIGHLY WHEN IT’S PHYSICALLY IN
FRONT OF THEM

You go online to reorder a box of your favorite pens. Will you value the product more if the
product page has a picture of the pens versus just a text description? Will you think the
pens are worth more if you’re in an office supply store and the pens are right in front of
you? Does it matter if you’re buying pens or food or any other product? Does the way the
item is displayed at the time you’re making the decision affect the dollar value that you
put on it? Ben Bushong (2010) and a team of researchers decided to test this out.
In the first set of experiments, the researchers used snack food (potato chips, candy
bars, and so on). Participants were given money to spend. There were lots of choices,
and the participants could pick what they wanted to buy. (They screened out people
on a diet and people with eating disorders.) Participants “bid” on the products so the
researchers could find out what the participants were willing to pay for each product.
Some participants were shown only the name and a brief description of the item—for
example, “Lay’s potato chips in a 1.5-ounce bag.” Some saw a picture of the item. And
some had the real item right in front of them. Figure 100.1 shows the results.

THE REAL DEAL COUNTS
Having a picture didn’t significantly increase the amount of money people were willing
to bid for the product, but having the product right in front of them definitely did, by up
to 60 percent. Interestingly, the form of presentation didn’t change how much people
said they liked the item, just the dollar value they were willing to bid. In fact, with some

224

HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

items that they said before the experiment they didn’t like, they still them valued more
highly if they were in front of them.

TOYS, TRINKETS, AND PLEXIGLAS
Next the researchers tried the experiment with toys and trinkets instead of food. Figure 100.2 shows the results with toys and trinkets. The chart looks very similar as with
the snack foods.

WHAT ABOUT SAMPLES?
Deciding to try another tack, the researchers went back to food items, but this time they
let people see and taste a sample. The actual item wasn’t there, but the sample was.
Surely, they thought, the sample would be the same as having the actual item in front of
them. Wrong again! Figure 100.3 shows that the samples were still not as powerful as
having the full product available.

The researchers note that in this taste condition, the participants didn’t even look at the
samples in the paper cup, since they knew they were the same as the food in the package.

IS IT OLFACTORY?
The researchers wondered if the food produced some unconscious olfactory (smell) cues
that triggered the brain, so they did another experiment, putting the food in view but
behind Plexiglas. If the food was in view but behind Plexiglas, it was deemed to be worth
a little more money, but not the same as if it were within reach. “Ah!” the researchers
thought, “There are olfactory cues!” but then they found the same result with the nonfood
items, so smell is not the trigger. Figure 100.4 shows the results for the Plexiglas trials.

A PAVLOVIAN RESPONSE?
Bushong and his team hypothesize that there’s a Pavlovian response going on: when
the product is actually available, it acts as a conditioned stimulus and elicits a response.
Images and even text could potentially become a conditioned stimulus and produce the
same response, but they have not been set up in the brain to trigger the same response
as the actual item.

Takeaways

Õ Brick-and-mortar stores may retain an edge if they have products on hand, especially
when it comes to price.

Õ Having a product behind glass or any other kind of barrier may lower the price that the
customer is willing to pay.
